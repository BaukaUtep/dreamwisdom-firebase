Taking a second ablution to perform one's prayers without the ritual need to do so in a dream means an increase in one's light. Taking ablution with milk or honey in a dream means debts. Ablution is a proper deed in all religions. It is a guard, a clemency, assurance of the divine protection, and immunity from punishment. Taking an ablution to perform one's prayers in a dream means entering under God's protection against what one may fear. It is reported in the traditions that God Almighty has said to Moses, upon whom be peace: \"When you are seized by fear, take your ablution and direct your family to enter the sacrament of prayers.\" Washing one's body in a dream is either performed in preparation for prayers or to wash away impurities. Taking ablution inside a tunnel, or taking a complete ritual bath in a dream, means recovering a stolen object. Taking one's ablution and engaging in prayers in a dream means relief from distress and offering thanks to God Almighty for His protection and guidance. If a merchant sees himself praying without ablution in a dream, it means that he has entered into a business venture without capital.

Taking ablution at the seashore or in a proper ablution area in a dream means dispelling one's fear, sorrow, or distress. Taking ablution while standing over a friend's head in a dream means inheriting him.

If one commits adultery with a young and beautiful woman in a dream, it means that he will place his earnings in a well-guarded place or a coffer. If a strong person commits adultery in his dream and if he has to face the divine ordinance and chastisement for his sin in the dream, it means that his authority will expand. If the person in the dream qualifies for leadership, then he will be endowed with one. If one sees himself committing adultery with the wife of a close friend in a dream, it means that he will take some money from him. If one reads the ruling of the divine ordinance concerning the punishment of adulterers in a dream, it means that he is an adulterer. If one deals with an adulteress or with a woman who has committed adultery in a dream, then such a woman represents the world and its seekers. If a student on the path of God Almighty, who is known to have piety, good conduct, and who has the look of a believer, sees himself dealing with an adulteress or a woman who has committed adultery in a dream, it means that he will join the company of a gnostic and learn wisdom at his hand. If one sees a man and a woman sitting alone in an intimate setting in his dream, and if he recognizes them, it means that he desires some worldly interests from such a man. If a man sees himself raping a young woman in a dream, it means that he hides his savings in an unknown place.

Walking in the air without ascending or descending in a dream means receiving dignity, honour, and earning lawful money. If one does not qualify for it, then walking in the air in his dream means traveling. Hanging in the air between the heavens and the earth in a dream represents a concerned heart and uncertainty about what to do! Falling in the air in a dream means despair or loss of status in wakefulness. Falling in a dream also means relief from distress, wantonness, or satisfying one's needs. Clear, fresh, and pure air in a dream represents a good time to take a trip for business or pleasure. Air in a dream also represents one's desire and passion. Thus, disobeying one's mind, desire, and passion in a dream means entering the heavenly paradise. Following one's desires in a dream means negligence of one's religious duties. Standing up in the air and speaking loudly in a dream means blessings, favours, money, honour, and fame. Sitting in the air in a dream means arrogance and self-deception regarding religious opinions. Building a house up in the air or placing a mat in the air, or raising a tent in the air, means the death of a sick person, and what is built in this case is one's coffin. If a governor sees that dream, it means his dismissal from his office or his death. Seeing that dream after a wedding or after having marital relations with one's wife means mistrust and loss. It also means involvement in an uncouth action, lacking knowledge of the Holy Book and prophetic traditions, because what one has built lacks a foundation. Flying in the air in a dream may mean traveling. Flying with wings in a dream has stronger connotations and is safer. The wings here will represent money or power. Swimming in the air means benefits or business travels. If the air looks opaque in one's eyes, so that he cannot see the skies in his dream, it means problems with one's superior. If one does not have a boss, then it means that they may lose sight. If all the people witnessed the air as opaque or red in the dream, then it means a major calamity and a trying adversity.

    "meaning": "God Almighty, Lord, Creator and Cherisher of the universes. There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the Al-Seeing Lord. Seeing God in a dream can be interpreted according to one's state of being. If one sees Him in His glory and majesty, without descriptive designation, without ascription of human characteristics to Him, and without depiction or portrayal in the dream, it is an indication of glad tidings for both this world and the hereafter. These blessings may also continue to affect the lives of one's progeny. If one sees Him otherwise in a dream, it means confusion, and particularly if the Almighty Lord does not address him. If an ailing person sees Him in a dream, it means that he will soon die and come to meet Him. If a straying soul sees God Almighty in a dream, it will find guidance. If an oppressed person sees Him, it means that justice will prevail and he will triumph over his oppressors. Hearing God's words without designation represents the imagination of the person in the dream. Perhaps hearing His words in a dream appeases one's heart and increases the person's drive for success. Hearing God's words without seeing Him represents the rising of one's station. If one receives revelations from behind a veil in a dream, it means mental confusion and innovation. This is most true if a messenger comes in one's dream and describes the one who spoke as God. In this case, the dream is a nightmare, because God Almighty cannot be depicted according to human descriptions. If one sees a picture of God in his dream, it means that he is a liar who ascribes images to God Almighty that do not befit His Majesty and Glory. If one hears God Almighty talking to him directly and if he can focus on Him in the dream, it means that he will be encompassed with God's mercy and blessings. If one sees God Almighty in a dream, it means that he will look at His Divine countenance in the hereafter. Seeing God Almighty seated on the Divine Throne in a dream means elevation of one's rank, knowledge, and increase in his wealth. If one sees himself running away to hide from God Almighty in a dream, it means that he will change the course of his devotion into heedlessness. Seeing a veil separating the servant and his Lord in a dream means that one will commit major sins and abominable actions. If one sees his Lord frowning at him, whereby he could not bear the effulgence of God's light, or if he is seized by a shock and immediately commences to repent and pray for forgiveness in the dream, it means that such a person is indulging in abominable actions, and that he is a despicable sinner who follows his mind and desires, and that he is an innovator of religious thoughts who misleads the people. If one hears God Almighty talking to him in a dream, it represents an admonition and a warning to abstain from sin. If one hears God Almighty talking to him in a dream, it also means that one is more assiduous in his recital of the Qur'an. If one hears God Almighty talking to him with words he cannot understand, then if He anoints him and blesses him in the dream, it means that God Almighty will bring him nigh unto Himself and exalt his station. If one sees God Almighty in a form resembling one's father, a brother, or a relative and showing His kindness or blessing him in a dream, it means that he will be afflicted with a calamity and a major illness. If a righteous person sees himself standing before God Almighty in reverence and filled with awe in a dream, it means that mercy will encompass him and help him to further his growth. The same interpretation applies if one sees himself prostrating before Him. If God Almighty speaks to someone from behind a veil in a dream, it can also represent a good worshipper, but if the Divine address takes place without a veil in the dream, it means falling into sin. If God Almighty names someone in his dream with his birth name, then adds another title to it, it means rising in station and rank. If one sees God Almighty angry with him in a dream, it means that his parents are displeased with him. This description includes seeing oneself falling from the sky or the top of a mountain. If a devoted servant sees God Almighty kissing him in a dream, it applies to his growing devotion and reward. Fearing God Almighty in a dream reflects eminence, peacefulness, quiescence, wealth of being, and disregard for material needs.

Thus, having a dream during the month of Muharram could be even called a vision, and it never fails. Such a dream means success, relief from difficulties, release from prison, or recovery from an illness. If the person had retreated from his town, he would return to it. This interpretation is based on the story of God's prophet Jonah, upon whom be peace, after he emerged from the belly of the whale. Perhaps the person in the dream may face a great spiritual challenge in his life, or it could mean the death of a great man of knowledge, or the emergence of such a gnostic or wise man in that city. If the person seeing the dream is a sinner, it means that he will repent of his sins, for God Almighty has accepted the repentance of Adam, upon whom be peace, during that month. If the person in the dream hopes for a station of honour, he will attain it, because God Almighty has raised the Prophet Enoch (Idris), upon whom be peace, to a high station during that month. If a traveller sees a dream during that month, it means that he will safely return home from a long journey, because it is the month in which the Prophet Noah, upon whom be peace, was saved with his people, and it is the month in which the ark settled on top of Mount Judiyyi. If the seer desires a son, then he will beget a righteous son, because it is the month in which God's prophets Abraham and Jesus, upon both of them be peace, were born. If the person seeing the dream is suffering from tight financial circumstances and if he desired a way out, it means that he will see the light or escape from the danger of his enemy, because this is the month in which God's prophet Abraham was saved from the fire of Nimrod, or perhaps, if he had followed a path of innovation and falsehood, he will turn back to God Almighty and repent of his sin, because it is also the month in which God Almighty forgave the prophet David, upon whom be peace. If the person in the dream is impeached from his leadership position or stripped of his status, he will return to his office and regain honour, because it is also the month in which God Almighty returned the Prophet Solomon to his kingdom. If one is bedridden, it means that he will recover from his illness, because it is the month in which the prophet Job recovered from his illness, or perhaps it could mean that one will be sent as an emissary with a mission, or as an ambassador, because it is during this month that God Almighty spoke to His prophet Moses upon whom be peace. As for the second lunar month, known in Arabic as ~afar, having a dream during it could be interpreted as follows: If one is pessimistic about what he saw, then it could mean the opposite. If he is sick, it means recovering from his illness. If one is needy, it means that their needs will be satisfied. If one is suffering from stress and worries, it means that they can cause them no harm. If one sees his dream during the third lunar month, known in Arabic as Rabiul Awwal, and if he is a merchant, it means that his business will grow, prosper, and that his money will be blessed, or perhaps he may conceive a child during that month. If he is under stress and worries, they will be dispelled. If he is persecuted or treated unjustly, he will end in a triumph, or it could mean that he will hear good news, or he may be appointed as a governor, or he may admonish people to do good and discard evil, for it is the month in which God's Prophet Muhammad, upon whom be peace, was born to this world. If one's dream takes place during the fourth lunar month, known in Arabic as Rabiul Thiini, and if it suggests glad tidings, then one may have to wait and exercise patience, but if it suggests evil, then such a happening will come fast. During this month, seeing a dream also means victory over one's enemy, or it could mean conceiving a blessed son who will grow to become a gnostic, or a hero, for it is during this month that the Imam 'Ali, may God bless his countenance and be forever pleased with him, was born. As for the fifth lunar month, known in Arabic as Jamiul Awwal, seeing a dream during this month means that one should slow down or scrutinize his buying and selling, or it could mean that he may lose his daughter or wife, for it is in this month that the daughter of God's Messenger, upon whom be peace, Fatima died. May God be forever pleased with her. If the dream happens during the sixth lunar month, known in Arabic as Jamadu Thaw, and if the dream carries a good meaning, it will come, but slowly, and one should not contradict it. If one sees this dream during the seventh lunar month, known in Arabic as Rajab, it means that he will gain honour and status, for it is the month of the Prophet's Ascension (Miraj) and his night journey to the seventh heaven. A dream during the eighth lunar month, known in Arabic as Sha'ban, represents honour and ranks, for during this month, every good deed will be honoured. As for the ninth lunar month, known in Arabic as Ramadan, in it, all difficulties will be suspended, evil will be shunned, and stinginess will be dispelled. During this month, all that is good will manifest, and bad dreams will dissipate to become null and void. During this month, the dreams of a believer may be differently interpreted than the dreams of a disbeliever. If one sees the month of Ramadan in his dream, his dream means blessings, profits, commanding good and forbidding evil. If the person is seeking knowledge, then knowledge will be given to him, for it is during this great month that the Holy Qur'an was revealed. If the person is afflicted with epilepsy, he will recover from it, for the devils and all evil spirits are shackled and are rendered powerless during this month. As for the tenth lunar month, known in Arabic as Shawwal, if one's dream suggests a war or a conflict, it means that he will come first in it, and that he will triumph. If one sees the month of Shawwal in his dream, it means that he will come out of difficulties and find happiness and devotion, for it is the month during which God's House, known as the Kaaba, was built. As for the eleventh lunar month, known in Arabic as Zul-Qi ‘dah, if one's dream suggests a trip, then the person should refrain from taking that trip, or perhaps he should delay it for the better. He should also guard himself where he lives. If the dream denotes stress or worries, then he should avoid whatever may cause them. However, if one's dream takes place during the twelfth lunar month, known in Arabic as Zul-Hijja indicates a journey, then one may take it, or if it denotes a good business, one should seek it, for it is a most blessed month and it is the month of festivities and sacrifices. If one sees this month in his dream or sees himself offering sacrifices in it, or if he sees himself praying the festival of Sacrifice prayers in it, his dream means paying one's debts or fulfilling one's vows, repentance from sin, guidance or perhaps his dream may indicate the death of great people of knowledge, the impeachment of governors, the changing of governments, or it could mean a sudden war.",

If one sees himself standing in 'Arafa during the nighttime in a dream, it means that his goals will be attained and that he will satisfy his quest. If one sees himself standing in 'Arafa after the sunrise, it means that his question will find no answer.

It is said that to be buried alive in a dream means losing one's spirituality or religious commitment, unless one comes out of it alive. If one walks out of his grave covered with dirt, then shakes off the dust in the dream, it means that his state is hopeless or that his repentance has little chance to hold. To be buried alive in a dream means imprisonment or despise by others, or a severe punishment which makes one's chastisement an exemplary lesson to others, Ifa gnostic or a wise man is seen buried alive inside his own house, or if he is brought out of it alive in a dream, it means that one will inherit him in knowledge, wisdom and status. The same interpretation is given if one sees a prophet or a holy man walking out of his grave alive. To be buried after death, after sunrise, at noon, or the sunset in a dream means that one is being warned about doing what is good and abstaining from what is evil. To be buried alive in a dream is wrong and means betrayal. It could also mean marriage, prosperity, or peace and tranquillity after suffering and hardships. If one sees a deceased person burying him alive in a dream, it means that one's due debts are not paid, or that one will be imprisoned to satisfy his debts, or that his collateral was not accepted. To bury a dead person twice means that one is covering his faults. If one sees a deceased person burying another deceased person in a dream, it means unity, clearing of the hearts, love and friendship between relatives, or perhaps it could mean imprisonment, marriage, a sickness, a trust, or guaranteeing a loan. Seeing oneself being buried after death in a dream means that one needs to repent before death. Should he still walk alive from his burial in the dream, it means that he may repent again. God knows best. (Also see Cemetery, Grave)",

Hearing the call to prayers in a language other than the Arabic in which it was revealed in a dream means lies and backbiting. If one sees a woman calling to prayers, standing on the top of a minaret in a dream, it means innovation and trials. If children give the call to prayer in a dream, it means that people filled with ignorance will rule the land. This is particularly true when the call is made outside the proper time. If a suitable person sees himself adequately calling to prayers in a dream, it means that he will be appointed to govern a land that is as vast as his voice can reach in the dream. If one does not fit the conditions of ruling, then it means that his enemies will increase in number. If he is a merchant, it means that his business will grow.

If one's call is made while travelling in a caravan or a marketplace in a dream, it means that he will expose a band of thieves. If he makes the call to prayers from inside a ruin in a dream, it means that such a place will be rebuilt and people will live in it. If one sees himself calling to prayer from inside a bathhouse or while under the shower in a dream, it means that he will suffer from a fever. If he sees himself calling and no one is answering his call in a dream, it means that he belongs to the company of unjust people.

It is also said that if one sees the prophet David in a dream, that his country or town will be governed by a just ruler, an honourable president, or a righteous judge. If the ruler or the judge of that town, county, or country is an unjust person, then seeing God's prophet David in a dream means that God Almighty will surely replace him with a just and honourable one.

    "meaning": "In a dream, death signifies religious failure, corruption, and rising in status in the world. This interpretation applies if one is carried on a bier or a litter and his funeral is accompanied by crying and lamentation, except if he is buried in the dream. If one witnesses his burial in the dream, then it means that his case is hopeless and that he will be seized by the world. One's followers or assisting entourage will be as many as those who walk in his funeral in the dream. However, he will conquer people and ride over their shoulders. If one dies in his dream but does not have the look of dead people and there is no crying over his death or a funeral in the dream, it means that one of his properties will be torn down, or that a room in his house will collapse, or that a wall will cave in, or it could mean that a pillar will breakdown. Such a dream may also signify weakness in one's religious standing or blindness of his heart. Despite that, he will live a long life. If one dies in a dream and finds himself looking like a dead person, and if his body is washed and wrapped in a shroud, it also means weakness in his religion. All the sorrow and crying one sees in this case represent his rising in rank and promotion in the world. Death in a dream also signifies travels, or it could mean poverty. One's death and burial in his dream also means that he will die short of repentance. If one comes out of his grave after his burial in the dream, it means that he will repent for his sins before dying. Death in a dream also signifies marriage, for a deceased person is washed and perfumed, and a bridegroom also takes a bath and anoints himself with perfumes on his wedding day. If one dies and is carried over people's shoulders, though they do not bury him in the dream, it means that he will conquer his enemy, and should he qualify for leadership, he will attain it. To come back to life after dying in a dream means that one will become rich and dispel poverty, or it could mean that he will repent for his sins. This dream also means the safe homecoming of a traveller. The death of an unknown woman in a dream means absence of rain or dearth, and if she comes back to life in the dream, it means rain.

If he sees them drinking from the wells in a dream, it means that a great plague will befall that town.

What a deceased person says about himself in a dream is true, for he has reached the abode of truth, and he can exercise no falsehood in that abode.

If one sees a deceased person sick in a dream, it means that his condition is contingent upon the satisfaction of his debts and that he is awaiting the Divine justice to take its course. Performing a funeral prayer for deceased people in a dream means asking for forgiveness on their behalf or visiting their graves, or it could mean admonishing someone with a dead heart, or it could mean bidding farewell to travelling people or taking care of needy people. If one's wife dies and returns to life in a dream, it means making profits from a plantation or a farm. Discovering the body of a deceased person in a dream means finding money. Walking behind a deceased person in a dream means following his footsteps or emulating his trade or traditions, whether they be material or spiritual.

If he is sick in the dream, it means that he is answerable to God Almighty for his religious negligence. If the deceased person's face looks dark or opaque in the dream, it means that he died as an unbeliever. If one sees a deceased person sprightly, pleasant, and casual in a dream, it means that one's dream is a mere hallucination, or that he is experiencing disturbed dreams, for dead people do not joke and have their duties to respond to. If one's deceased father or mother comes back to life in a dream, it means relief from distress and the abolishing of his fears. This is particularly stronger when one's deceased mother is seen in the dream. Resurrecting a deceased person in a dream means giving guidance to an unbeliever or admonishing an innovator. This also could mean admonishing heedless people who will repent for their sins. If one sees a deceased person die again in a dream, it means that someone by the same name will shortly die. If a deceased person complains about a migraine headache in a dream, it means that he is being questioned about his religious negligence or his injustices, or his abominable attitude toward his father or mother. If the deceased person complains about his eyes in the dream, it means that he is being questioned about what he owes to his wife or about her dower or about a will or a trust he wasted.

However, if someone hears the quacking of a duck inside his house in a dream, it means difficulties in that place, or an announcement of someone's death. (Also see Swan's meat)",

Dyeing one's hair in a dream also connotes a display of blessings and favours, or it could mean dictating one's conditions to his enemy, if the person is in such a position. However, if not, it means difficulties, aggravation, distress, debts, or dropping off one's ties with those who love him. Interpreting a woman's dyeing of her hair in a dream is the same as that of a man. To dye one's grey hair in a dream means strength, dignity, and valour. Applying henna dye to one's head and not to one's beard in a dream means emulating the traditions of God's Prophet, upon whom be peace. To dye both the head and the beard in a dream means concealing one's poverty, though one will keep asking people to pay him respect or to recognize him in their circles. If one's hair accepts the dye in the dream, it means regaining one's status, though with less emphasis on his pride, or it could mean that he will make contentment his new ornament or trim. If one uses a dye other than what is commonly used, and if it works in the dream, it means that he will be saved from an adverse condition through miraculous events. If the new dye does not work in the dream, it means that his true nature will be exposed, and he will have no solutions to protect himself from defamation or public abuse. If he tries to dye his hair with dry henna clay, and if his hair still accepts it in the dream, it means that he is an ignorant person, though he will ultimately repent for his sins, amend his actions, and improve himself.

Dyeing only the finger with henna in a dream represents branches of dates or clusters of grapes. In general, dyeing one's hands with henna or one's hair with regular dye as makeup in a dream represents joy for the husband and wife as long as they do not exceed the norms. Dyeing one's hands and feet in a dream means redecorating one's house. If a poor person sees himself dyeing his hands or hair in a dream, it means that he will cover up the loss of his ablution during prayers or his reading of the Holy Qur'an or during other ritual occasions where he is required to have ablution before proceeding. It could also mean that he cares little about attending his prayers. As for women, dyeing means happiness, new clothing, receiving gold, or a wedding celebration. If the dye exceeds the required surface of the hands or the feet in the dream, it means being struck with fear and worries caused by one's business or friends. If a man sees himself in a dream dyeing his hair or beard with something other than henna, it means that he will suffer from what he fears most. Dyeing or suppressing one's feelings for a sick person means recovering from his ailment. Dyeing one's hair black in a dream means hiding one's bad conditions, spoiling the benefits of one's deeds, or hiding one's evil intentions.

If one discovers that he has an extra ear in a dream, it means permission is given to him to fulfill what he intends. The number of ears one sees in a dream also represents the different arts and sciences, but they could also mean that the person in question has no stability. In a dream, one's ear may represent the jewellery a woman attaches to herself as ornaments. To clog one's ears with one's fingers in a dream means death in a repugnant state of innovation.

On the other hand, if one strikes a flint stone with a piece of steel and produces sparks from it in his dream, it means that he will witness an awesome fight between two rock-hearted and cruel people. Striking a flint stone in a dream also means the marriage of an unwed person. If a woman sees herself striking a flint stone with a piece of steel, and if she can produce sparks in the dream, it means that she will beget a son. If a spark starts a fire in the dream, it means that one's wife will become pregnant, or perhaps it could represent a fight between the husband and the wife, or a fight between two partners. If the sparks burn one's gown in the dream, it means that harm will affect that house, and such harm will bring about losses in money, family honour, or bodily injury. If the sparks burn a notebook in the dream, it means deviation from God's path. ",

If one sees himself shaking hands and embracing his enemy in a dream, it means that their disagreement will cease. If one sees the angels greeting him in a dream, it means that his insight will grow. Greetings in a dream represent submissiveness, surrender, or the need for a reply concerning an interest one has with the other party. If one commences talking to someone before greeting him in a dream, it means innovation, and the same interpretation is given if he does not reply to a greeting, or if he replies with a gesture. Paying the regards of peace at the end of one's prayers in a dream means pursuing one's path, following the proper traditions, completing one's job, resignation from one's job, appointment, dismissal, travels, and profits. If one ends his prayers by beginning his greetings from the left, then proceeding to the right in a dream, it means that he pursues the road of evildoing and innovation. If one ends his prayers without the traditional greetings in a dream, it means that he is more interested in collecting his profit than in protecting his capital investment. (Also see Prayers)",

If one looks into the pages of the Holy Book and finds its lines crooked in a dream, it means that he lives satisfied with what he has and fulfills his required duties accordingly. Stealing a copy of the Holy Book and hiding it in a dream means that one cheats in performing his prayers, or fails to do them properly.

Seeing him in a dream could denote a time of rising prices, drought, loss of one's family, or suffering from people's stratagem, entering a prison, and then being released by God's grace. It also denotes one's luck with women and adversities related to one's beauty and good character. Seeing God's prophet Joseph in a dream also means acquiring knowledge about dream interpretation, or catching one's enemy, ferrying him, or digging a river, a water irrigation, or transporting dead people from one country to another. It also could represent a great advent or a miracle by the fact that he had performed a miracle by God's leave and restored his father's sight. Joseph's shirt in a dream means dispelling distress, sorrows, and recovering from illness. If the shirt is spotted with blood in the dream, then it means separation and imprisonment. If his shirt is torn from the back in the dream, it means a false accusation. If a woman sees Joseph in a dream, it means that she will lose her comfort and sight. She will also live unhappily because of her separation from her beloved, and she will fall in love with a great man. If the woman who is suffering from such adversity sees such a dream, it means that God Almighty will turn to her with mercy and guide her to repentance. If she is unmarried, it means that she will get married. If she is poor, it means that she will become rich, and her life in this world as well as in the hereafter will turn to her advantage. Seeing Joseph as a young boy in a dream means having little or no luck with one's brethren. He will be lied to, suffer from imprisonment and other trials before he recovers, to rise and triumph over them. They will all then become his subjects. One who sees God's prophet Joseph in a dream will also be a pious, generous, charitable, who shares his good advice with those who need it or ask for it. If Joseph talks to someone, or gives him something in a dream, it means that one will understand dream interpretations and learn about Chronicles, or the two biblical books of History. Seeing him in a dream also means marriage to a beautiful woman who will truly love her husband. (Also see Jacob, Sale)",

If one is appointed to be a judge in a dream, it means that he will be just and righteous. If one sees himself sitting on the bench, but finds himself unable to handle people's cases with justice, it means that he is an unjust person. If one presides over people in a dream, it means that he may be dismissed from his job. If a traveller becomes a judge in a dream, it means that he will be held up by robbers, or it could mean that God's blessings upon him will turn into a curse. If one sees a known judge being unjust in a dream, it means that the people of that locality are inequitable and that they cheat in their weights and measures. If one sees himself standing before a judge, and if the judge treats him fairly in the dream, it means that he will find justice concerning a personal case involving himself and an adversary, or it could mean relief from depression and stress. If the judge is inequitable in the dream, it means that one will lose to their adversary. If someone sees a judge holding the scale of justice and the scale tilts to one's favour in the dream, it represents glad tidings of a great reward from God Almighty for one's deeds. However, if the scale of justice tilts in the opposite direction, then it represents a warning from God Almighty for one to repent of his sins or abandon his involvement in a sinful venture. If one sees the judge weighing pennies or bad monies in the scale of justice, it means that one will give false testimony, which will be accepted. If one sees himself as a judge, a wise man, a scholar, or a righteous man in a dream, it means that he will attain fame, good reputation, ascetic detachment, and spiritual knowledge if he qualifies for that. If one is not suitable for such blessings, then it means that he will be falsely accused of a crime or that he may be robbed during a trip. If a judge looks cheerful in a dream, it means glad tidings. Seeing the bench of a judge in a dream means a scare or a fight. Seeing the seat of rulers, judges, speakers, scholars, or teachers in a dream means disturbance, sorrow, money, business losses, sickness, depression, or the surfacing of hidden secrets. If a sick person sees himself standing before a judge in a dream, it means his death. However, if the case is decided in his favour in the dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. If one who is facing adversities sees himself sitting in the judge's bench in a dream, it means that he will triumph. An unknown judge in a dream represents God Almighty.

Seeing the holy Kaaba in a dream also means that one may enter it, or it could mean receiving glad tidings and dispelling evil. Praying inside the holy Kaaba in a dream means enjoying the guardianship and protection of someone in authority, and safety from one's enemy. Entering the holy Kaaba in a dream means entering before a ruler. Taking something from inside the holy Kaaba in a dream means receiving something from the ruler. If one of the walls of the holy Kaaba crumbles in a dream, it means the death of the Caliph or the local governor. Entering the holy Kaaba and failing to perform any of the prescribed rites in a dream means standing before God Almighty on the Day of Judgment, having performed one's obligations, or it could mean repenting from one's sins. To look at the holy Kaaba in a dream means safety and protection against fear. If one is given a job in Mecca in a dream, it means that he may become an Imam. Stealing anything from the holy Kaaba in a dream means sinning. Walking toward the holy Kaaba, or seeking it in a dream, means correcting one's religious standing. Seeing oneself in Mecca mixing with departed souls who are inquiring from him about the world in a dream means to die testifying to the Oneness of God Almighty and to the prophethood of His Messenger, upon whom be peace. Seeing the Kaaba inside one's own house in a dream means that one is still in power and living with grace. If the holy Kaaba does not look right in one's eyes in the dream, then it means adversities. If one sees the holy Kaaba as his own house in a dream, the holy Kaaba then represents the Imam of all Muslims, who is the representative and vice-regent of God's Messenger, and it means that one truly follows the Imam. Praying on top of the holy Kaaba in a dream means becoming an apostate. Entering the holy Mosque in Mecca and praying on the roof of the holy Kaaba in a dream represents peace, tranquillity, presiding over others, it also means that one will become victorious wherever one goes, though with a questionable conduct, he also may follow innovation and depart from the traditions and teachings of God's Messenger, upon whom be peace. Walking by the holy Kaaba, or leaving it behind in a dream, means going against the traditions of God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, following the path of innovation, or interpreting things according to one's mind and liking. If one sees angels descending from the heavens to lift away the pillar of God's House from Mecca and place it in a different town in the dream, it means that people have gone astray, and the time of destruction has come. It also means that the pillar of the faith, the righteous guide of the believers, and God's vice-regent on earth, AI-Mahdi, will soon emerge to dwell in that town. If one sees the holy Kaaba burning in a dream, it means that one has neglected or abandoned their prescribed prayers. Any changes, decrease or increase in the shape of the holy Kaaba, moving of it away from its place, or changing its look in a dream will reflect upon the Imam, or the guide of all Muslims. Circumambulating the holy Kaaba or performing any of the prescribed rites in a dream means walking the path of righteousness, or correcting one's religious life as much as one does in his dream. Failure to perform some of the prescribed rites that are associated with being at the holy Kaaba in a dream indicates one's deviation from God's path, and such innovation is equal to changing the direction (arb. Qibla) of one's prayers. The holy Kaaba in a dream also represents one's prayers, for it is the focal point of all praying Muslims. The holy Kaaba in a dream also represents God's House, a mosque, a community centre of all Muslims, and it represents a teacher, a guide, Islam, the holy Qur'an, the prophetic traditions, one's son, a religious scholar, a shaikh, a master, a husband, one's mother, and the heavenly paradise. The holy Kaaba is God's House, and thereat people will be gathered and led into paradise. The holy Kaaba in a dream also represents the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, the gathering of believers, the local markets, and the vicinity of the holy Mosque. If one sees that his own house has become the Kaaba and people are seeking it and crowds are gathering at his door in a dream, it means that he will be endowed with wisdom, gain knowledge and act upon it, and that people will learn at his hand and follow his example. Performing some of the required rites at the holy Kaaba in a dream also means that one may work for someone in authority, or serve a man of knowledge, a shaikh, a renunciate, one's father, one's mother, or it could mean that one has a master who demands clarity, true following and hard-work from his students and disciples.

Killing a human being in a dream means committing an evil and atrocious sin. On the other hand, committing an outrageous sin or a conspicuously objectionable act in a dream may mean killing someone. If one is killed in a dream, it means longevity and that he will acquire great wealth from the one who kills him in the dream.

Killing someone in a dream also means relief from depression, grief, affliction, and sorrow. Killing oneself in a dream also means recognition of the value of lost benefits. If one is murdered in a dream and does not know who killed him, it indicates his failure to fulfill his religious duties.

If one sees the king frowning in a dream, it means that he fails to properly perform his prayers or show true religious devotion. If one sees him smiling in a dream, it means profits in one's material as well as spiritual life. If one sees that God Almighty has appointed him as a king over a land, it means that he will receive such a regency, should he qualify. Later on, unrest will bring tyrants or dictators to justice, while people of knowledge and piety will survive and regain their authority. If one sees himself as a caliph or as an Imam in a dream, and should he qualify, it means that he will receive such an honour, rank, trust, and fame in the land, though his vice-regency will not become hereditary. However, it is a bad omen if he becomes a caliph in the dream and does not qualify for such an appointment. In such a case, and by contrast, he will be humiliated and dispersed, and his helpers will become his superiors, while his enemies will rejoice at his misfortune. If one sees himself as a king in a dream, though in reality he does not qualify, it means that he may die quickly, and the same is true if a sick person sees himself turned into a king. If he is healthy, it means that someone in his family may die shortly. Seeing a king in a dream also denotes exposing hidden secrets. If a philosopher or a fortune-teller sees himself transformed into a king in a dream, then it denotes glad tidings, should he not complain about it in his dream. If a slave sees himself becoming a king in a dream, it means that he will be set free. If one sees himself becoming one of the great kings of this world in a dream, it means that he will attain worldly success in his life, though it will be accompanied by religious failure. If the person is a natural con artist, it means that he will be captured and imprisoned. If a man sees himself awarded a knighthood that is suitable only for a woman, then it means his death. If one sees the king reprimanding him in a dream, it means peace between them. If one sees himself arguing a case with knowledge and wisdom before a king in a dream, it means that he will win his case and receive what he came for. If one sees himself complaisant with the king about his case in the dream, it means that he will lose his case, and the judgment will go the king's way. If one sees himself walking with a king and rubbing shoulders with him in the dream, it means that he will oppose the king or disobey him. If he sees himself following the king in a dream, it means that he will pursue the king's traditions during his lifetime or after his death. If one enters the king's palace prostrating in a dream, it means that he will be appointed to a leadership position and receive the king's pardon. If one sees himself mixing with the king's harem, or sleeping with them, and should there be signs of comfort, trueness, or wisdom in his act in the dream, it means that he will enter the king's inner circles. Otherwise, should he in the dream fear the consequences of what is happening, or if he lacks trueness, or if he slanders them, or indulges in what is unlawful for him to do, then should he reach the king's door, it means that he will triumph against his enemies inside that palace, and they can cause no harm to him. If in his dream, the king gives him a gift, it means that he will win victory and honour in his life to equal the value of that gift. If the king gives him a brocaded silk garment in the dream, it means that he will give him a wife from the royal family. If the king speaks to someone in a dream, it means honour, fame, wealth after poverty, release from jail, expansion of one's business, or victory over one's enemy. If an appointed governor sees himself looking into a mirror in a dream, it means that he will be dismissed from his post. If an appointed king sees someone who looks like him sitting on his throne in a dream, it means that he will beget a son. If he divorces his wife in a dream, it means that he will abdicate his throne. To see oneself sleeping with the king in the same bed and without a curtain between them, and if the king leaves the bed while one remains resting therein in the dream, it means that his mixing with the king will incur jealousy, or that he will inherit him. If one leaves the bed before the king, it means that he will escape from a great danger.

    "slug": "masjid",
    "label": "Masjid",
    "meaning": "(arb. God's House, Mosque, Place of worship) In Arabic, the word masjid means a place of prostration, while the word Jami means a place of gathering. A masjid or a mosque in a dream represents a scholar, and its gates represent men of knowledge and the guardians, or the attendants of God's House. Building a masjid in a dream means emulating the traditions of God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, fostering the unity of one's family, or becoming a judge, should one qualify for such an office. A masjid filled with people in a dream represents a gnostic, a man of knowledge and wisdom, or a preacher who invites people to his house, advises them, brings their hearts together, teaches them the precepts of their religion, and explains the wisdom behind the divine revelations. Seeing a masjid being demolished in a dream means that such a gnostic, or religious scholar and devout believer, will die in that locality. In a dream, if the roof of a masjid caves in, it means that one will indulge in an abominable action. If one sees a stranger performing his prayers in a masjid in a dream, it means that the Imam of that masjid will die from a terminal illness. If one enters a masjid in the company of a group of people, and if they dig a small hole for him inside the masjid in the dream, it means that he will get married. If one's house becomes a masjid in a dream, it means that he will attain piety, purity of heart, ascetic detachment, and an honour he will receive from his brethren. He will also call upon them to follow what is true and to abstain from what is false. If a masjid is transformed into a bathhouse in a dream, it means that a chaste person will turn corrupt or become heedless. A masjid in a dream also represents a marketplace or a business. If one has to climb up a staircase to reach the masjid in a dream, then the masjid represents a thrifty person who does not like to share what he has. If one has to climb down a staircase to reach the masjid in a dream, it means that his needs will be satisfied. If a masjid in the city is moved to a remote village in a dream, it means stagnation of one's business, being ostracized from one's community, or it could mean legal complications related to one's inheritance. If a ruler builds a house for God Almighty or a masjid in a dream, it means that he will be a just ruler and he will govern his subjects by the divine laws. If a religious scholar builds a masjid in a dream, it means that he will author a book that will benefit others, or deliver a commentary on a complex religious issue, or, if he is wealthy, it means that he will pay the alms tax due on his assets. Building a masjid in a dream also means getting married, or conceiving a child who will grow to become a righteous and knowledgeable scholar, or if one is poor, it means that he will become rich. Otherwise, it means that one will serve God's House and fill it with invocations, supplications, serving the interests of the community, leading the people to unity and love, and teaching them to value obedience to God's commands. Building a masjid in a dream also could mean becoming a real estate agent, or repenting from one's sins, or receiving guidance on God's path, or to die as a martyr, hence, what one builds for God Almighty in a dream represents his house in paradise. Such interpretation applies if one builds a masjid following the proper procedures and with lawfully earned money, and using proper materials. Otherwise, building it with what is unlawful of money or materials in the dream, or changing the direction of the prayer niche, etc., then one's dream will carry the opposite meaning. If one builds a masjid or a fellowship house in a dream, it means that he will seek the path of knowledge and wisdom, or that he will attend a pilgrimage during that same year, or establish a permanent business, such as a hotel, a bathhouse, or a shop, etcetera. Building the roof of a masjid in a dream means taking care of orphans or sponsoring homeless children. Expanding a masjid in a dream means an increase in one's good deeds, repentance from a sin, adopting good conduct, or being just. Seeing oneself inside a new masjid one does not recognize in a dream means attending the pilgrimage to God's House in Mecca during that same year, or joining religious circles to learn about one's religion. If one's shop becomes a masjid, or if the masjid becomes a shop in the dream, it denotes lawful earnings, or it could mean mixing lawful and unlawful earnings. A forsaken masjid or mosque in a dream means intentionally ignoring the value of gnostics and religious scholars, or denying the necessity to command what is good and to eschew what is evil. A forsaken masjid in a dream also denotes the presence of ascetics who have renounced the world and its people and care less about their material possessions. A known mosque in a dream represents the city where it is erected. For instance, the Aqsa mosque in a dream represents Jerusalem, the Sacred mosque represents Mecca, the Prophet's Mosque represents Medina, the Omayyad mosque represents Damascus, Al-Azhar mosque represents Cairo, and the Blue mosque represents Istanbul, etcetera. A known mosque in a dream also could represent the renowned scholars who live in that place, or the ruler of that country, or any of his ministers. If one enters a mosque and immediately after crossing the entrance gate, he prostrates himself to God Almighty in the dream, it means that he will be allowed to repent for his sins. If one comes to a masjid and finds its doors locked, then if someone opens the door to him in a dream, it means that he will help someone in paying his debt, then extol his good virtues in public. If one enters a mosque riding on an animal in a dream, it means that he will cut off his connection with his relatives, leave them behind, and forbid them to follow him. If one dies in a masjid in a dream, it means that he will die as a true penitent. If the carpet or the straw mat of a mosque becomes a shredded rag in the dream, it means that the community of that masjid is divided and corrupt. Building a masjid in a dream also means overcoming one's enemy. Entering the Sacred Mosque in Mecca in a dream means arriving with one's bride to their new home, and it could mean fulfillment of a promise, being truthful, dispelling one's fear, and reaching the shores of safety.

If one does not like to sleep on his mattress in a dream and prefers to find another place to rest, it means that he will renounce his conjugal life. Folding one's mattress and placing it aside in a dream means leaving one's home for a long journey, divorcing one's wife, or avoiding sleeping with her for one reason or another, or it could mean the death of either the husband or the wife.

Seeing a meadow in a dream also means receiving inner knowledge that is imparted directly by God Almighty through mystical inspirations, or it could mean establishing a charitable endowment. A meadow with its pasture, streams, perennials, and spireas in a dream represents the world, its ornaments, attractions, and wealth. A meadow in a dream may also mean a place of business or a workplace. To see and cherish a green meadow without being able to unfold its reach in a dream represents the vastness and essence of Islam. If a poor person sees himself walking through the meadows, gathering grass, leaves, herbs, flowers, and eating them in his dream, it means prosperity. If a rich person sees that in his dream, it means that his wealth will increase. If someone who has renounced the pleasures of this world or an ascetic sees such a dream, it means that he will return to desiring it, or that he will be seduced by the world again. Walking between meadows in a dream means going on a business trip or changing one's profession. The same interpretation is given if one sees oneself walking between two different markets. If one sees a deceased person sitting in the meadows in a dream, it means that he is in paradise. Meadows in a dream also represent the world and its pleasures, or they could represent a rich wife. Seeing an unusual meadow which is admired only when beheld, and enjoyed especially when visited in a dream, represents a revered place, a house of God, a mosque, the grave of a prophet, or the graves of the righteous ones. A meadow in a dream may also represent the Book of Revelation, the Qur'an, knowledge, wisdom, or paradise. If one sees himself walking from the midst of meadows into a salt swampland or a marsh in a dream, it means that he follows innovations, or that he indulges in sinful actions.

    "meaning": "(Educator, Eyebrow, Governess) Seeing one's mother in a dream has a deeper and stronger meaning than seeing one's father. All the same in one's dream, seeing her means attaining one's goal. Man's dreams are most pleasing when he sees his parents, grandparents, or a relative. If one is going through difficulties and sees their mother in a dream, it means that help will come their way from sources he does not anticipate. If in real life he is awaiting someone's return from a journey, that person could arrive shortly. If one is sick, it means that they will be cured of their illness. If one sees his mother giving birth to him, should he be ill in real life, then it means the approach of his death, for a deceased is wrapped in a shroud, while a newborn is wrapped with a receiving cloth. If the person in question is poor, then seeing his mother in a dream means that his financial condition will change for the better. If he is rich, it means restrictions on his earnings, for a child is dependent on others, and his movements are restricted. (Also see Earth)",

    "label": "Mountain",
    "meaning": "A mountain in a dream represents a great and noble man who possesses a strong a commanding voice, who commands good administration of his affairs and excellent leadership. It can also be interpreted as a son, a difficult and austere woman, or a businessman. If the mountain is rounded or flat in the dream, it means difficulties or distress. A mountain in a dream could also mean achieving one's goal, a journey, or fulfilling a promise. If the mountain is standing distinct from other mountains in the dream, the above meanings become stronger. If the mountain has pasture and stores a source of water, and if it is used as a permanent guarding post, then it represents a pious ruler. However, if it stores no water, and if no pasture grows therein in the dream, it represents a tyrant and a ruler who is an atheist, for in that case, it is dead and does not glorify God Almighty, nor can people benefit from it. In a dream, a mountain that stands high is alive, but a crumbling mountain that has turned into a pile of rocks is dead. If a person sees himself climbing an erect mountain, eating from its plants and drinking from its water, and if he qualifies to govern, it means that he will be appointed to a governing post under the auspices of a stringent ruler, though his subjects do receive benefits from his government. The size of the benefits the governor will acquire is equal to the quantity of food and the amount of water he drinks from it in his dream. If the person is a merchant or a businessman, a mountain in his dream represents profits and earning a good reputation. If climbing the mountain is easy, then there are no benefits in that climbing in the dream, for there are no benefits without hardships. If at the end of his climbing, one thanks God Almighty for what he has reached in the dream, it means that he will become a just ruler. If he calls to prayers on the top of a mountain or performs his prayers thereat in the dream, it means that he will be appointed to govern. If one sees himself descending a mountain in a dream, it means loss of rank, business losses, or regret. If one is accompanied by his king and soldiers in a dream, it means that he is in the company of God Almighty and that of His angels, therefore, he shall be victorious, whereby he can win a war, conquer an enemy, or renounce his attachment to the world. If climbing a mountain with difficulty means distress, then descending it in a dream means relief. If climbing means gaining a higher station, then descending in a dream means losing rank. If one sees himself climbing a mountain, though at a certain height he finds himself no longer able to climb or to descend in the dream, it means that he will die young. If one sees himself falling from a mountain in a dream, it means that he will fall into sin. If he falls and breaks a leg in the dream, it means that he will become despised by his superiors. A mountain on fire in a dream represents the death of a dangerous person. Leaning against a mountain in a dream represents friendship with someone in authority. Living in the shadow of a mountain in a dream means earning one's livelihood from such a person and living happily there. Carrying a mountain in a dream means carrying the responsibility of managing the business of a notable merchant, and such responsibilities will bear heavily on him. If the mountain is radiant with lights, it means that one's responsibilities will be light too. If he sees a mountain descending from the heavens in a dream, it represents a visit of the local governor to that locality. If one sees the mountain rising into the skies in a dream, it means that the governor of that town will be dismissed. Throwing stones from the top of a mountain in a dream means insulting others. If the mountain is beautifully dressed in the dream, it means that one will command a greater authority. Seeing a mountain at a distance in a dream means a journey. If one sees an earthquake hitting a mountain in a dream, it means that calamities will befall that land or country. If an evildoer sees a mountain in his dream, it means that he will surely suffer for his sins. Swallowing a mountain in a dream means commanding and controlling ruthless and strong men. Climbing a mountain until one reaches a flat surface in a dream means serving orphans or nursing sick people. Entering a cave inside a mountain in a dream means reaching safety. The good or evil emanating from seeing a mountain in one's dream depends on its fertility or barrenness. Climbing a mountain and enjoying its vegetation and its sweet fresh waters in a dream means sheltering one's chastity in the company of one's wife, or learning a knowledge or a trade that will satisfy one's needs. Climbing a mountain through a straight path in a dream means facing things the way they are. If one sees mountains moving forward with him, it means a war or a major conflict between people of knowledge. Falling from the top of a mountain into the middle of beasts, crows, vultures, snakes, mammals, mire, filth, or rats and their different kinds in a dream means abstaining from sins, or refraining from innovation if escaping from them leads one into a mosque where he can enter to pray, or a garden where he can rest in peace. If the mountain crumbles, and if it is transformed into ashes or dirt in the dream, it means that whoever is meant in that dream shall lose their devotion and waste their life.

    "slug": "muhammad",
    "label": "Muhammad",
    "meaning": "(God's Prophet Muhammad, blessings and peace be upon him, The Seal of the prophets, The last Messenger) It is related that God's Messenger, upon whom be peace, has said: \"One who sees me in a dream will see me in his wakefulness, for Satan cannot impersonate me. \"He also has said: \"One who sees me in a dream, it is as if he has truly seen me, for Satan cannot impersonate me. \" He also has said: \"One who sees me in a dream will not enter the fire of hell.\" Muslim theologians and scholars differ in opinion about the meaning of seeing God's Prophet in a dream. Imam Ibn Seerin used to ask someone who tells of such a dream to describe the Prophet, upon whom be peace. If any of the details did not fit his description, Ibn Seerin's reply was: ''You have not seen him.\" Asim Bin Kulayb once said: \"I related to Ibn Abbas, God bless his soul and that of his father, that I saw God's Prophet in a dream. Ibn Abbas replied: \"Describe him to me.\" Asim Bin Kulayb added: \"I described him as resembling Al-Hassan son of 'Ali, upon both of them be peace.\" Ibn Abbas replied: \"Indeed, you have seen him.\" Ibn 'Arabi once explained that the essence of seeing God's Prophet is cognizance of his presence and understanding the reality of his character and example. Thus, recognizing the presence of the blessed being is an affirmation of the truth, while seeing the physical form represents his example and attributes, for being earthly does not change the essence of prophethood. When God's Prophet said, \"He will see me in wakefulness,\" it means: 'Expounding upon what he saw,' for what one sees in such a dream is the truth which resides in the realms of the unseen. In the second saying, when God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, said: \"It is as if he has truly seen me,\" it means that if one had seen him during the time of delivering God's message, the example will be the same. Thus, the first saying signifies what is real and true, while the second saying implies the physical reality and its example. If one sees God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, coming toward him in a dream, it means blessings and benefits, and if one sees God's Prophet turning away from him in a dream, it means the opposite. AI-Qadi Iyad, God bless his soul, interpreted the words of God's Prophet in his saying: \"Has truly seen me,\" to mean: \"has truly seen my physical form,\" that the blessed companions knew, while seeing him in another form in a dream means that one's dream connotes personal interpretations. Following the explanation of AI-Qadi Iyad, Imam Al-Nawawi commented by saying: \"This is a weak explanation. A stronger interpretation is to say that one who sees God's Prophet in a dream has seen him in reality, however, his resemblance may appear. Whether the resemblance in the dream is known or not.\" In a separate commentary, Shaikh Al-Baqlani added: \"What AI-Qadi Iyad has said does not contradict what Imam Al-Nawa has said.\" This is because the first dream does not require interpretation, according to AI-Qadi Iyad. In the second type of dream, which is discussed in Imam Al-Nawawi's comments, one's dream does require interpretation or analysis. This means that since no Satan can impersonate God's Prophet, then whatever appearance he displays in one's dream is true. The meaning of God's prophet's saying: \"For Satan cannot impersonate me,\" implies that since God's guardianship (Isma) is inviolable, and since God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, is sacrosanct, then as he was protected during the time of delivering God's message to humanity, he is still protected by the same guardianship after God Almighty took him back to Himself. Thus, whoever sees God's Prophet in any appearance in a dream, it is as if they have seen him in reality, regardless of whether one sees him as a young man, or at the time of delivering his message, or as an old person. If one sees him looking old in a dream, it means peace. If one sees him looking young in a dream, it means war. If one sees him smiling in a dream, it means that one is truly emulating his traditions. Seeing God's Prophet in his known and recognized appearance in a dream means that the one seeing the dream is a pious person, that his integrity is inviolable, and that his success is unquestionable. Seeing him in a dream, frowning, represents the ill state of the one seeing the dream. Ibn Abi Jumrah once said, \"Seeing Him in a beautiful appearance denotes the good religious standing of the person seeing the dream. Seeing him with some disfeatures in a dream, a deficiency or distortion in one's application of his religious duties, for God's Prophet is like a mirror that portrays the one standing before it.\" In this sense, the person seeing the dream can recognize their state. This interpretation is also given by Ibn Hajar Al-Hutaymi, God bless his soul. Like that, in the book of Sharh al-Shama-il of Imam Al-Tirmithi, it is also stated that Satan cannot impersonate God Almighty, His signs, prophets, or angels. If someone suffering from distress sees God's Prophet in a dream, it means that his difficulties will be removed. If a prisoner sees him in a dream, it means that he will be released from prison. If one is living at a time of economic chaos, and if high prices are exploiting the people of the land, or if injustice is tyrannizing everyone, then seeing God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, in a dream represents an end to such adversities. Seeing him in his beautiful, radiant, and impeccable appearance, as best described by his companions in a dream, means glad tidings of attaining a successful conclusion to one's life in this world and in the hereafter. The state and clarity of one's heart and how well polished his mirror is determine in what appearance he may see him, upon whom be peace. If God's Prophet comes toward someone in a dream, or leads him in prayers, or if one sees himself accompanying him on the road, or if one eats something sweet from his blessed hand, or receives a cloak, or a suitable shirt, or if God's Prophet promises him something, or prays for him, then if the one seeing the dream qualifies for leadership, and if he is a righteous and a just man who commands what is good and forbids what is evil, and if he is learned and practices what he knows, and if he is a pious worshipper and a devout Muslim, he will then attain the station and company of the blessed ones. If the one who sees the dream is a disobedient servant of God Almighty, it means that he will repent for his sins and return to his Lord. If he is living in heedlessness, it means that he will be guided. Perhaps, he might attain his goals in acquiring knowledge, or learn how to reconstruct his innermost being to befit a human being who is grateful to his Lord. If one fears oppression, persecution, or loss of his property and wealth, seeing him in a dream, it means putting an end to such fears, for he is the best of intercessors to restore anyone before God Almighty. If one who follows innovations sees God's Prophet in a dream, it means that he should fear God Almighty, heed His warnings, and correct himself and particularly if he sees Him walking away from him, or turning his back to him. Seeing God's Prophet in a dream also means receiving glad tidings and happy news, or it could signify justice, establishing the truth, fulfillment of a promise, reaching a high rank among the members of one's family, or perhaps it could mean that one may suffer from their envy and jealousy, or leave his homeland and migrate to another country, or it could mean that he may lose his parents and become an orphan. Seeing him in a dream also could mean seeing miraculous events (Karamat), for his companions witnessed and testified to a deer greeting him, a camel who kissed his foot, the broiled leg of mutton talking to him, trees moving to give him cover, pebbles glorifying God's praises in his hand, among countless miracles, including his Nocturnal Journey and ascension (Miraj) to the heavens to meet his Lord. If an ophthalmologist sees him in a dream, it means that he will acquire great expertise in his field and become renowned in the land, for God's prophet upon whom be peace, did return the eye of his companion Qutadah to its place and made his sight sharper than it was by God's leave, after Qutadah had lost his eye during one of the battles with the unbelievers. If a traveller in the desert sees God's Prophet in a dream, or if there is drought somewhere, it means that rain will fall and springs will gush forth, as water gushed from between his blessed fingers when he placed his blessed hand over a half-filled cup to quench the thirst of an entire army. If calamities, starvation, and drought have befallen a land and someone sees Him in a dream, it means that such calamities will be lifted and life will return to normal in that place. If a woman sees him in a dream, it means that she will reach a high spiritual station, honour, righteousness, chastity, trustworthiness, and perhaps be given a blessed progeny, or if she is wealthy, it means that she will spend her wealth on God's path. Seeing him in a dream also means facing adversities, bearing patience, and suffering from one's enemy. If an orphan sees him in a dream, it means that he will reach an exalted station, and the same goes if a foreigner sees him in his dream. If a physician sees him in a dream, it means that people will benefit from his medicine. Seeing him in a dream also means victory over one's enemy, or consolidating and paying one's debts, or recovering from an illness, or attending a pilgrimage to God's House in Mecca, or triumphing over one's trials, or cessation of one's adversities, or fertility of a barren land, or the pregnancy of a barren woman. If a visitor to his mosque sees himself in a dream coming before God's Prophet and finds him standing up, it denotes one's correct religious standing, and it means that he will have commanding authority over the Imam of his time. If one finds him deceased in the dream, it means that a noble person from the family of the person seeing the dream will shortly die. If one sees the funeral of God's Prophet in a dream, it means that a calamity will befall that country. Following his funeral procession up to his grave in a dream means that the person seeing the dream will yield to innovations. Visiting his grave in a dream means receiving a great treasure. If one sees himself as the son of God's Prophet in a dream, and even if one is not one of his descendants, it denotes one's sincerity, true faith, and certitude. Seeing God's Prophet by one person does not exclude the remainder of the believers, but the blessings encompass all of them. Receiving something from him, such as food or a drink, in a dream means benefits and profits. If one receives food whose substance connotes negative circumstances, such as a melon or the like elements in a dream, it means that one will escape from a great danger, though he will toil and suffer from hardships during his trials. If one sees that one of the limbs that belongs to God's Prophet has become his own in a dream, it means that he is following innovation and making changes in the laws God's Prophet brought to humankind. If one sees himself in a dream embodying the form of God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, or wearing one of his garments, or receives his ring, or sword, then if the person is seeking to govern, he will attain that and the people will accept his leadership. If one is suffering from persecution or humiliation in the land, then seeing God's Prophet standing in a dream means that God Almighty will grant him victory and make him rise above his enemies. If one is poor, his needs will be satisfied, or if he is unmarried, he will get married. If one sees him in a ruined place in a dream, it means that such a place will be rebuilt. If one enters a room and finds him sitting there in a dream, it means that a miraculous sign, or a major event, will take place in such a locality. If one sees him making the call to prayer in a dream, it means that prosperity will spread in that place. If one sees him establishing the prayers in a dream, it means that the Muslims will reunite and dispel their differences. If one sees him placing kohl over his eyelids in a dream, it means that he will find safety and correct his religious stand, or it could mean that one will study and become a scholar in the field of the prophetic sayings. If a pregnant woman sees him in a dream, it means that she will give birth to a son. If one sees him having a black beard with no grey hair in it in a dream, it will bring happiness, joy, and prosperity to one's life. If God's Prophet is seen as an old man in a dream, it means strength in one's life and victory over one's enemy. Seeing him in his most exalted state in a dream means that the Imam, or the ruler of the country, will rise in station and that his authority will expand. If one sees his blessed neck wide, it means that the Imam is holding firmly to his trust. If one sees him having a large chest in a dream, it means that the Imam or the ruler of the country is generous toward his subjects. If one sees his blessed stomach empty in a dream, it means that the treasury of the country is empty. If one sees his right hand closed in a dream, it means that the Imam or the ruler of the country does not pay his employees, or distribute the collected alms tax. If one sees his blessed right hand open in a dream, it denotes the generosity of the ruler and his compliance with the distribution of charities and alms tax as prescribed in God's book. If his hands are locked together in a dream, it means complications in the life of the Imam, or the ruler of the country. The same will affect the life of the person seeing the dream, including suffering from distress and adversities. If one sees his blessed leg beautiful and hairy in a dream, it means that one's clan will become stronger, and his tribe will grow. If one sees the blessed thighs of God's Prophet tall in a dream, it denotes longevity of the Imam or the ruler of the country. If one sees him standing amid soldiers and everyone is laughing and joking in a dream, it means that the Muslim army will be defeated and humiliated in a war. If he is seen with a small army that is ill-equipped and everyone is looking down in the dream, it means that the Muslim army will triumph in that year. If one sees him combing his blessed hair and beard in a dream, it means that one's distress and adversities will be dispelled. Seeing him in his mosque, or any mosque, or his usual place in a dream, it means gaining power and honour. If one sees him standing amid his companions delivering a revelation in a dream, it means that one will acquire greater knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual understanding. Seeing the grave of God's Prophet in a dream means prosperity and profits for a merchant, or the release of a prisoner from jail. Seeing oneself in a dream as the father of God's Prophet means that one's faith will diminish and his certitude will weaken. If a woman sees herself in a dream as one of the wives of God's Prophet, it represents her growing faith. If one sees him looking into one's affairs in a dream, it means that God's Prophet is admonishing the one seeing the dream and commanding him to render his wife her due rights. To walk behind him in a dream means following his (Sunnah) traditions in wakefulness. To eat with him in a dream means that one is commanded to pay the annual alms tax (Islamic law) due over one's money-making assets, or liquid assets, gold, silver, jewellery, savings, etc., excepting one's home or vehicle. If one sees God's Prophet eating alone in a dream, it means that the one seeing the dream refuses to give charity and disdains to help those who ask for his help. In this sense, it is as if God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, is commanding the person to give charities and to help the needy. If one sees him barefoot in a dream, it means that one has neglected to do their regular prayers. To see him and to shake hands with him in a dream means that one is truly his follower. If one sees his blood mixed with that of God's Prophet in a dream, it means that one will marry a woman from among his descendants, or that one will marry the daughter of a great religious scholar. If God's Prophet gives someone some type of greens or herbs in a dream, it means that one will escape from a great danger. If he gives him something fresh or honey in the dream, it means that one will learn the Holy Qur'an and acquire great knowledge and wisdom according to the amount he receives in his dream. If one returns the gift to God's Prophet, it means that he will follow innovation. To see him delivering a sermon in a dream means that he is commanding people to do good and to eschew evil. If one sees the colour of his skin tan in a dream, it means that one will think about repenting from his sins and abstain from young people. If the colour of his skin is white in the dream, it means that one will repent for his sins and turn to God Almighty for acceptance. If he reprimands someone in a dream, it means that one must refrain from innovation and follow the prophetic traditions. If one finds that God's Prophet has died in a specific location in a dream, it means that the person seeing the dream will die in that same place, and God knows best. (Also see Visiting holy sites)",

In a dream, a woman's pregnancy means wealth, and a man's pregnancy means pain and sorrow. However, generally speaking, pregnancy in a dream could also mean prosperity and material success. The extent of wealth is measured by the number of months of such pregnancy and the size of one's growth in the dream. This is true whether it is a man or a woman in the dream. If a young boy who is under the age of puberty sees himself pregnant in a dream, it represents his father, and if a young girl who is under the age of menstruation sees herself pregnant, then it represents her mother. If a man sees his wife pregnant in a dream, it reflects his desire for material success.

If one sees himself delivering a baby from his mouth in a dream, it means his death, or it could mean that he will use poised and pleasant words in a conversation with someone he is careful not to offend. If a man gives birth to a baby boy in a dream, it means that he will carry a heavy burden and then escape from it, or it could mean that he will vanquish his enemy, or it could mean that he may escape from a treacherous woman.

A prophet in a dream also represents a religious scholar, because religious scholars are the heirs of the prophets, upon all of them be peace. Religious scholars also know God's prophets better than the common people. They understand their message and follow their traditions of glorifying God's Oneness, devotion, piety, prayers, charity, acting upon what they know, and admonishing others to follow the path of truth and righteousness. A prophet in a dream also represents one's superior, a preacher, a righteous Imam, a conscientious teacher, and a caller to God Almighty. Seeing any of God's prophets looking gracious, stately, and courtly in a dream also represents his people's devotion, or that a major and positive change will take place among his followers. If such a prophet looks spurious, unhappy in a dream, or if he appears in a state that does not befit God's prophets, it means that his followers in the world have deviated from his path and created their own religion, opposing his commands, falsifying and interpreting his message to their liking, and abusing his admonition. If one claims to be a prophet in a dream, it means that he will become known in his field, or if he qualifies, he may become a ruler, a judge, a teacher, or a caller to God Almighty, commanding what is good and forbidding what is evil. Otherwise, it means that he will be afflicted with a great calamity because of a falsehood he fosters, or innovations he practices. If one becomes a messenger in a dream or a caller to God Almighty, and if someone hearkens to him and accepts his message in the dream, it means that he will rise in rank. Otherwise, it means that he will become a broker, a liar, a defrauder, a swagger, depending on his level of knowledge, or it could mean that he will be struck with a major calamity in his life. Such a calamity will be of the same calibre, degree, and nature that a messenger of God Almighty may have suffered from his people. Seeing one of God's prophets in a dream also means living the experience of time, space, and condition in which he saw him in the dream. Wearing the cloak of one of God's prophets in a dream means attaining one's goals, or presiding over people, or acquiring true knowledge. Consequently, one will become renowned, revered, and his opinions will be respected by most people. If one becomes a prophet in a dream, it means that he will die as a martyr, or become poor and be gifted with patience and endurance. He will then be granted victory, and God willing, all his needs will be satisfied. Emulating the devotion of a prophet in a dream means trueness in one's faith, compliance with God's religion, certitude, and determination. Becoming one of God's prophets, upon all of them be peace and blessings, in a dream means commanding good and forbidding evil, suffering from adversities and distress equal to those endured by such a prophet, then one will escape from destruction or humiliation by God's leave and through His subtle kindness. If one sees a prophet suffering from poverty and asking for help in a dream, it means that God Almighty will satisfy all the needs of the person seeing such a dream for the sake of the blessings reserved for that prophet. If one kills a prophet in a dream, it means that he will betray a trust, negate a promise, or deny a covenant. Living in the time of one of God's prophets on earth in a dream means honour, dignity, success, piety, and wealth if one is suited for such gifts. Otherwise, it means that Satan is deceiving him. If a prophet of God Almighty beats a righteous and sincere believer in a dream, it means that he will attain peace and salvation in his life in the hereafter. If a prophet talks to someone in a dream, it means that he will receive blessings, honour, status, knowledge, wisdom, and fame in his life. (Also see Muhammad, upon whom be peace.)",

Slaughtering and skinning a ram, then hanging it in a dream, means stripping one's enemy of his money and wealth. Seeing a skinned ram inside one's house in a dream means the death of a relative. If it is the leg of a ram, then it means the death of the closest relative. Broiling a ram in a dream means governing for one year, after which period one may be imprisoned. The number of rams in a dream represents the number of years. Thus, seeing them also represents the number of years one will serve in their job. The wool of a ram in a dream means money. A ram in a dream also represents the muezzin in a mosque, a general in the army, a deposed ruler, or a humiliated person. If a ram attacks someone in a dream, it signifies an attack by one's enemy.

Riding on a workhorse that is fitted with a harness, or on a bridled nag in a dream, means occupying an important office and letting everyone who works for the leader make an oath of allegiance before hiring them for work. If the bridle and the martingale are unadorned in the dream, then such a dream represents a humble person, and connotes that his heart is better than what his outer look may suggest. Reins in a dream also connote safety or a safety belt. Wearing a harness in a dream means safety, and that one does not interfere with others' business or talk about them. However, should one who has to appear in court see himself wearing a harness in a dream, it means that his proof will not be accepted by the judge, and subsequently he will lose his case. If the reins of one's horse are broken in a dream, it could mean the death of his rider. Reins in a dream also denote chastity, guardianship, and protection.

Seeing the Day of Resurrection in a dream also denotes justice. Being the only person resurrected on such a day means one's death. Standing up awaiting judgment on the Day of Resurrection in a dream means travels. If one sees himself and his wife being the only people who are brought for judgment on the grand Day of Gathering in a dream, it means that he is being unjust. If a warrior sees the Day of Resurrection in a dream, it means that by God's decree, the aggressor shall be defeated. The land of the grand gathering in a dream represents a chaste woman or a noble man. The blowing of the Trumpet of Resurrection in a dream represents the salvation of the righteous ones. Seeing any of the great, extraordinary events or signs that shall precede the Day of Resurrection in a dream means glad tidings for a believer who does good, and a warning for a disbeliever to correct himself and repent for his sins before it comes. Seeing the Day of Resurrection in a dream also denotes that some of the major signs are taking place, such as blood shedding, spread of evil, belligerence of atheism, pride about wealth, ruling of the working class, building high rises, the end of the era of kings on earth, or it could remind the person of the prophesied signs, such as the rising of the sun from the West, the emergence of a beast that will speak with a human tongue, the rising of the Imposter (arb. Dajjal, Antichrist), etcetera. Seeing the Day of Resurrection in a dream also represents the spread of evil, the presence of an extended police force, and the ruling of large armies and dictatorships around the world. Thus, seeing the Day of Resurrection in a dream is a reminder and a warning to the one who sees it. If one sees the graves splitting open, dead people resurrected back to life and are walking out of them, accompanied by their angels in a dream, it means that justice will prevail in that land. If one experiences the resurrection in a dream, then discovers that the world went back to continue its prior course, it means that justice will dominate that land for a while, then it will be followed by a tyranny that will be carried by people who are not even suspected to be of such character. Such a dream also could be interpreted to suit a person who is seeking the impossible, or one who is adamant in pursuing the path of wrongdoing, falsehood, and lies. Recognizing the imminent final signs of the Day of Reckoning in a dream means that one is unaware of his heedlessness, and such a dream constitutes a warning. If one's reckoning is easy in a dream, it denotes his wife's piety, compassion, and love for him. If one's reckoning is detailed and painful in a dream, then it represents major losses. If one's good deeds weigh heavier than his bad deeds in the dream, it means that his devotion is true and that his reward will be greater. If one sees himself carrying the scale to weigh his deeds in a dream, it denotes his righteousness and correctness. If one sees an angel handing him his records and telling him to read his book in a dream, it also means that he is on the right path. Walking on the bridge of the Day of Judgment, carrying one's records and crying in a dream means that one is praying for God's forgiveness and to ease his reckoning. If one sees Doomsday in a dream, it means that he will escape from dangerous enemies, or that perhaps a major trial will befall the dwellers of that place. If one crosses the Bridge of Judgement in a dream, it means that he will escape a major trial, or perhaps it could represent a major hurdle one may have to cross in this life. If one sees himself carrying his book of records in his right hand in a dream, it means that he will win righteousness, wealth, and honour. If one sees himself carrying his book of records in his left hand in a dream, it means that he will fall into sin and the consequent poverty and need of others, for wealth and adultery do not mix. If one witnesses the emergence of the Imposter (Antichrist) in a dream, it signifies new trends, innovations, and masses straying from the straight path.

If one sees his ribs standing out or exposed in a dream, he may face punishment for a crime or a sin he has committed. If one's ribs grow strong and the flesh surrounding them becomes healthier in a dream, then they represent prosperity, recovering from an illness, gaining weight, or growing fat. If one sees himself in a dream without ribs, it means that he will lose what the ribs represent of either a wife, a child, money, or perhaps, he could have engaged in something wrong, thinking it to be right. One's ribs in a dream also mean a sickness, or bending of one's shoulders because of old age.

Otherwise, if one sings off-key in their dream, it means that he is venturing into a losing business. A singer in a dream also represents a wise person, a preacher, or a physician. The location where the singing has taken place in the dream will experience lies, falsehood, and separation between beloveds because of jealousy, envy, and perfidy.

    "meaning": "(Castle, Child, Firmament, Heavens, House, Mother, Oath, Ocean, Prison, Teacher, Town, Wife, Wonders) In a dream, the sky represents itself. Whatever descends from it or comes from that direction in a dream will materialize. If fire falls from the sky over people's homes in a dream, it means plagues, illness, pleurisy, smallpox, or death and destruction. If fire falls over the marketplace in the dream, it means higher prices. If it falls over the fields and farmlands in the dream, it means that the crops could either burn, freeze, or be struck by a swarm of locusts or by other harmful insects. What falls from the sky indicates prosperity, such as honey, oil, figs, barley, or money etc. In the dream, it means good rain and a good harvest for that year. Whatever falls from the sky of good or bad, may represent the government and the hardships it inflicts upon the people, or the benefits it may bring them. Climbing to the sky with a rope, a ladder, or using a staircase in a dream means exaltation, rising in station, good luck, and support. If one climbs without a common medium in a dream, it means fear and arrogance. If his intention in climbing is to spy on others in the dream, it means that he may work as a spy. If one descends safely from the sky in the dream, it means that he will escape and be spared the consequences of his sin. If he falls and breaks or fractures a bone or so in the dream, it means that he may suffer such an accident in wakefulness. If a sick person sees himself climbing to the sky, and if he does not return to earth in the dream, it means that he may die from his illness. If he comes back in the dream, it means that his illness will increase and his difficulties will reach their peak, though God willing, he will recover from his illness, unless he falls into a hole in a dream. In that case, the hole represents his grave. If one sees the sky shooting arrows causing people wounds, injuries, and bleeding in a dream, it means taxes and confiscation of properties by the government. If the arrows hit people's ears and eyes only in the dream, it means that major trials and temptations will strike everyone. If the arrows fall without causing harm to anyone, and if people rush to collect them in the dream, they represent a booty that people will come to win, or a divine gift people will enjoy. To rise close to the sky in a dream means nearness to one's Lord. This is particularly true for pious people and for true believers. Nearing the sky in a dream also represents a supplication needing an immediate answer, and God willing, such prayers will be answered. Nearing the sky in a dream also could mean going before the governor of one's town, or any person from whom one may need something, i.e., a teacher, a man of knowledge, a father, or a wife. If one sees the sky falling over his head in a dream, it means that the roof of his house may cave in, or that he will die from an illness he already suffers. If one sees himself climbing and entering the sky in a dream, it means that he will die as a martyr. If one sees himself standing in the sky in a dream, it means that he will command or admonish others. If one sees himself in the sky looking down at something on earth in a dream, it means that he will rise in station, and then he will regret something he missed. If one sees the sky green in a dream, it means prosperity and a good harvest. If one sees the sky turned into iron in a dream, it means drought or scarcity of rain. If one falls from the sky in a dream, it means that he may abandon his faith, become a reprobate, or that he may be struck with a major calamity that will be driven by an unjust person. If the iron sky splits open, and if an old man appears from behind it in the dream, such an old person represents the grandfather of the people of that town or tribe. Consequently, people will enjoy a good harvest, prosperity, and happiness. If it is a young man who appears in the dream, then he represents an enemy and an evil that may befall the people following such a dream. If a sheep appears from the sky in a dream, then it means profits. If camels appear, then they represent rain. If a lion appears in the dream, it represents an unjust ruler. If the sky becomes one solid piece in the dream, it means drought. If it rips apart and its doors become wide open in the dream, then it means rain or an answer to people's prayers. If one sees himself reaching out and touching the sky in a dream, it means that he is seeking an important goal, and that he will fail to attain it. If one sees himself rising near the lower heavens in a dream, it means worldly gains, or profits and status in either material or spiritual realms. If one looks toward the sky, whether to the East or the West, in a dream, it means travel. If one sees himself stealing the sky and hiding it in a jar in a dream, it means that he may steal a copy of the holy Qur'an and hide it with his wife. If one sees the sky wide open in a dream, it means blessings and benefits. If one sees himself rising toward the sky in a flat posture in a dream, it means that he will become emaciated or suffer losses in his business. On the other hand, if one sees himself rising without difficulty and without being laid on his back in a dream, it means exaltation, success, and safety from any harm that could be driven by one's enemies. If one bites the sky in a dream, it means that a calamity will strike at him, or it could mean business losses, failure to attain one's goals, or an argument with one's superior at work. If one sees himself touring the sky, then returning to earth in a dream, it means that he may become an astronomer or an astrologer and gain fame in his field. If one sees himself leaning his back to the sky in a dream, it means that he may win a leadership position, or win a victory over his opponents. If one sees himself in the sky having a form different than that of human beings in a dream, it means that he may leave this world unblessed. If one sees himself hanging down with a rope from the sky in a dream, it means that he will govern after someone else's, or inherit his post. However, if the rope breaks in the dream, it means that he may lose such an opportunity. If one sees a lighted candle in the sky whose lustre and brightness dims the light of the sun in a dream, it represents a solar eclipse. If one sees the sky being built in his presence in a dream, it means that he lies in his testimonies. Falling from the sky in a dream could also be a warning against falling into sin. Falling from the sky in a dream with one's head down means longevity. If one sees himself in the sky but cannot remember when he entered it in a dream, it means that, God willing, he is already in paradise. If one sees radiance, or scintillating rays of light coming through the sky in a dream, it means guidance. If he sees dark clouds coming through the sky in a dream, it means that he could stray from God's path. If he sees a scourge descending from the sky in a dream, it means that plagues and adversities will befall the people as a chastisement for their sins, or for crimes they have committed. As for gnostics and people of knowledge, seeing the sky in a dream means clarity, vision, placing one's interests in heavenly matters, or travelling to distant lands, or engaging in importing and exporting goods. Climbing into the sky in a dream also means falsehood, false beliefs, lies, or talking about God Almighty without the proper knowledge or guidance. Climbing into the sky in a dream also could mean seeking one's livelihood, satisfying one's needs, or fulfilling a promise. Skies in a dream also represent the ocean because of their vastness and the countless number of creation living therein, or they could represent the ripening of fruits, or the conclusion of one's work, or they could represent one's helmet, armour, wife, money, religion, death, or they could indicate slander and falsehood against someone who descends from them after being raised, and they could mean making peace with one's enemies, or they could represent the shares allotted for each one of God's creation, the good and the bad, people's sustenance and that of beasts, gains, losses, blessings or afflictions.

Admonishing people in a public gathering in a dream means that one's command will be obeyed. Sitting in the centre stage in a spiritual gathering in a dream represents one's station or rank, or it could represent one's wife, child, property, or personal secretary. Anything that happens to such a gathering in the dream may reflect on any of them. (Also see Fellowship, Gathering, Mosque)",

Leaning on a hollow staff in a dream means losing one's wealth and keeping it a secret. If the staff of a governor, or a leader, or a manager is broken in a dream, it means that he will lose his post. If he is a merchant, it means that he will lose his business. If one sees himself hitting the ground with his staff in a dream, it means that he will have control over that land, preside over its people, or triumph over the landlord. If one turns into a staff in their dream, it means a quick death. A broken staff in a dream represents a sickness that will lead to debilitation and complete loss of power. A staff in a dream also means giving orders, victory over one's enemies, or attainment of one's goals. If the staff is made from a branch of a palm tree in a dream, it means isolation. If it is made from a branch of an almond tree in the dream, it means banishment. If it is made from a branch of a plum tree in a dream, it means religious hypocrisy. A staff in a dream could also represent a snake or sorcery. Hitting someone with a staff in a dream means using harsh language with him. If a poor person hits a rock with his staff, and if water gushes forth from the rock in the dream, it means prosperity. If a rich person sees such a dream, it means an increase in his wealth.

A stairway in a dream could also represent the days of one's life and their term. If one sees a staircase that he recognizes in the dream, it could represent the servant of a house, its owner, or its accountant. If a sick person sees himself climbing an unknown staircase which is leading him to the upper room from where he can see paradise in the dream, it means that he may die from his illness and reach what he saw. If obstacles hinder his way or impede his climb in the dream, it means that he is detained, and the immediate blessings of such a gift will be veiled from him. Descending a staircase in a dream means arriving from a journey, resigning from a job, impeachment, or it could represent a pedestrian. If one's descent leads him to his family, house, or farmland in the dream, it means money. If what he reaches at the end of the staircase is unknown, and if one meets people, or souls, he does not recognize in the dream, it also denotes what we have earlier explained. If during one's climb or descent he falls into a well, or if a giant bird grabs him and flies away with him, or if a beast devours him, or if he steps into a boat that sails away as he steps into it, or if he takes a step to find himself riding an animal, or a vehicle of some type, the staircase then represents the stages of one's life and what he encountered during the journey of his life, all replayed or screened before his eyes at the point of descending into his grave, or as a book one reads after his death. If he does wake up and finds himself healthy and fit, it means that he will become a tyrant, an unjust person, an atheist, and a reprobate. If one sees himself descending a staircase that leads him into a mosque, lush foliage, green fields, a fresh breeze of spring, or into a pond to take a ritual ablution to perform his prayers in the dream, it means that he will become a true believer, repent for his sins, and abandon his blameworthy conduct. Otherwise, if he descends upon adverse elements such as snakes, lions, steep hills, corpses, or a field of scattered remains in a dream, then it represents major trials and adversities. If the steps are made of clay in one's dream, they indicate positive signs. However, a stairway could be regarded as unfavourable if its steps are made of backed bricks. If they are made of stones in the dream, they mean business success, along with a heart like a stone. If the staircase is made of wooden steps in the dream, it means reaching a high rank, which is compounded with hypocrisy. If they are made of gold in the dream, then they mean achieving success and gaining authority. If they are made of silver in the dream, they represent one's entourage and attendants. Climbing a staircase in a dream also means sharpening one's intellect and awareness. In a dream, a stairway is also interpreted to mean leading a life of ascetic detachment and devotion. Coming near a staircase in a dream also means attaining success and a growing piety. Each step represents a different station. Climbing a staircase in a dream also represents the dangers one may have to cross. Seeing a staircase with five steps in a dream represents the five time prayers, or the pulpit where the Imam stands to deliver his Friday sermon. That is why some interpreters qualify the staircase in one's dream as glad tidings, good news, prayers, charity, alms giving, fasting, or a pilgrimage. God knows best.",

If the stars are gathered in one's house, and if their light is dimmed in the dream, it means that such people will secretly meet in that house under constraint, or because of a calamity. Holding a star in one's hand in a dream means begetting a noble son who will grow to be a great leader. Stealing a star in a dream means stealing a valuable thing. Seeing a star falling from the sky in a dream means that a calamity will befall that place, and it will particularly affect the life of a great and noble person, or it could mean the death of the governor of that town.

Seeing many stars inside one's house in a dream may also signify having a large family. Seeing the seven major stars, or the fixed stars of the solar system, in a dream represents the trades, businesses, knowledge, and leadership in the land. Each of such stars brings a different luck. Seeing a brilliant star in a dream means happiness and leadership. If a rich person sees the skies without stars in a dream, it means loss of his wealth. If a poor person sees the skies without stars in a dream, it means his death. Holding little stars in one's hand in a dream means acquiring fame and presiding over people. Seeing a star over one's head in a dream means becoming renowned and surpassing one's associates, or it could mean serving in a high-ranking position.

Riding a star in a dream means leadership, strength, and wealth. If one sees the stars fixed under his roof in a dream, it means a calamity, or destruction of one's house, or it could mean the death of the head of the household. Eating stars in a dream means swindling people of their money. Swallowing a star in a dream means mixing with noble people and sharing one's personal life with them, or it could mean insulting or slandering the companions of God's Prophet, upon whom be peace. Sucking on a star in a dream means learning at the hands of great scholars or a wise shaikh. If a fortune-teller or an astrologer sees himself eating stars in a dream, it means that he will be selected to fill an important job from which he will prosper. As for the majority of people, eating stars in a dream means death. Seeing the stars scattered in a dream means the death of great leaders or scholars, or it could mean a war. Seeing the stars falling on earth, then disappearing, or the lights of meteors entering the earth's atmosphere in a dream, represents great destruction and death. The falling of small stars in a dream signifies the death of unknown people and the meek ones, while the falling of large stars represents the death of renowned people. Seeing the stars falling from the sky could also mean becoming bald or losing one's hair. Whereby, the stars represent one's hair and the skies represent one's head. Seeing the stars during the daytime in a dream means scandals, notoriety, or major events and calamities. Seeing the morning stars in a dream means a wedding. Becoming a star in a dream means acquiring wealth and fame. Seeing stars that denote the coming of winter in a dream means distress and sorrow, while seeing the stars that denote the coming of summer in a dream means happiness and good living.

If it is a carved wooden statue in the dream, it means that he ingratiates himself with rich people, or with an unjust person in authority, through his religion. If the statue is built from wood in the dream, it means that one seeks religious arguments or disputes. If the statue is made of silver in the dream, it means that one elicits a sexual relationship with his servant, or with a foreign woman, or perhaps just a friendship. If the statue is made of gold in the dream, it means that one may commit an abominable action, or a religious inequity, or seek profits from someone at the expense of displeasing God Almighty, and consequently, one will suffer financial losses or health problems. If the statue combines mixed materials of bronze, copper, steel, iron, or lead in the dream, it means that such a person uses his religious garb to make profits, and that he often forgets about his Lord. A statue in a dream also means travels. Seeing a golden or a silver statue in a dream could also mean prosperity. Seeing a bronze statue of a young woman moving around in a dream means a good harvest, prosperity, or travels. If the statue is bigger than life-size, then it means a fright. Statues in a dream also represent one's children, his sexual drive, or his determination. If one sees himself worshiping a statue in a dream, it means that he is engaged in falsehood, giving preference to his desires and passions over obeying his Lord's commands. If one sees himself worshiping a golden statue in a dream, it means that he will solicit business from someone who worships God Almighty, though he will also suffer losses from such an association. It also means that he will lose his investment, and it will show the weakness of his faith. If one sees himself worshiping a statue made of silver in the dream, it means that he uses his religion to make business out of it, or to betray others through it, or that he will solicit the help of someone to do evil, or that he may sexually abuse a young girl who trusts his religious appearance. If one sees a statue and does not associate it with worship, or if he does not see anyone worshiping it in his dream, his dream then represents financial gains. A statue in a dream also means to be enamored with a woman or a boy. Statues in a dream also could mean deafness, idiotic behaviour, dumbness, attachment to anything in this world, making an idol out of it, such as one's love and attachment to his position, status, business, wife, beloved, house, or child, etcetera. If one owns a statue in a dream, it means that he may marry a deaf, or a dumb, or a non-intelligent woman, or that he may beget a child who will grow up having one or more of these defects. In whatever condition one sees the statue in their dream, it will reflect on any of the above. A statue in a dream also represents a generation. If the statue is missing something in the dream, such a defect will manifest in one's society. Seeing a statue in a dream could also reflect one's strength and determination. If one breaks a statue, or lames it, or damages it in a dream, it means that he will vanquish his enemy and earn rank and fame.

If in a dream one sees his stomach open, it means that his business may be temporarily put out of commission, or that he may lose any benefits he used to derive from it up to then. The other aforementioned elements also may apply. If the person in question is a pregnant woman, and if she sees her baby or any part of it comes out of her open stomach, this may mean that a jailed person in her family will be set free, or that the family graves will be desecrated, or that the body of someone in her family will be exhumed, thus uncovering its diseases and infestations, or it could mean that one's personal life will become public knowledge. If one is complaining of such an illness, their dream means that they will find a cure for it. If one sees that he has no stomach in a dream, it means that he may lose a friend, or that his guardian may die shortly, or that he may become a religious, ascetic, and devoted worshiper. If one sees fire coming out of his stomach in a dream, it means that he will repent for stealing the properties of orphans. If one sees himself crawling on his stomach in a dream, it shows him being needy and striving to barely feed himself, or it may denote his materialistic character.

A falling stone over the world in a dream means the wrath of God Almighty, a calamity, or that an unjust person will rule the land. If the stone splits asunder or explodes after falling in the dream, it means that the harm will touch every house. Carrying bags full of stones or moving mountains in a dream means attempting to do something difficult. Hanging a stone around one's neck as a charm in a dream means that an affliction or an evil will take place.

If one sees a watercourse flowing only in the direction of his house, then such adversities will be his lot.

A stream of flowing blood rather than water in a dream represents the deviation of one's wife. If one sees a stream running off its course or damaging people's crops in a dream, it means bad news. Blocking the path of a stream in a dream means separation between a husband and a wife, or avoiding a sinful action between unmarried relatives. If one sees himself standing behind a rivulet in a dream, it means that his wife will inherit him. If one sees the water of a stream flowing toward his own home or garden, and if he finds that its water has turned into blood in the dream, it means that someone will marry his wife after him.

If one receives the sun hanging as a necklace in a dream, it means that he will win a seat in the senate. If he goes near the sun or sits inside it in a dream, it means that he will acquire power, wealth, and support. Should he qualify, the stretch of his power will extend between the two horizons he sees in his dream, or it may mean that he will acquire knowledge coupled with fame. If one sees that he owns the sun in a dream, it means that his words will be respected and listened to by someone in authority. If someone in authority sees the sun looking clear and brilliant in the dream, it means that his authority will grow, or that he will assist someone in leadership. Otherwise, it means that he will live happily and acquire lawful wealth. If a woman sees such a dream, it means that she will enjoy her marriage and receive what pleases her from her husband.

The radiance of the sun in a dream means the reverence, might, and justice of the ruler of that land. If one sees the sun talking to him in a dream, it means that he will be honoured and commended by the governor. If one sees the sun or the moon talking to him, and if he then strolls away with them in the dream, it represents his death. If one sees the sun rising from an unusual direction in a dream, it represents beneficial knowledge he will acquire. If the sun shines over one's head and not the rest of his body in a dream, it means that he will receive a prominent responsibility. If its rays rise to shine over his feet and not the rest of his body in the dream, it means a farming project that brings him prosperity and lawful earnings.

If it shines over his chest and not the balance of his body in the dream, it means a sickness. If a woman sees that the sun has embraced her from her neck down in a dream, it means that she will marry a person in authority and for one night only. Should such a person divorce her the next morning, it means that she may become a prostitute. If the sun rises from one's open belly in a dream, it means his death. If one sees the sun setting and himself walking behind it, it also means death. If one sees himself walking behind the sun in a dream, it means that he will be captured and imprisoned.

If one sees the sun turned red in a dream, it means corruption. If it turns yellow in the dream, it means an illness. If it turns black in the dream, it means losses. If one seeks the sun after it sets in a dream, it means that whatever is destined for him, whether it be good or bad, has passed. If one sees the sun rising at a time different than its usual rising time in a dream, it means that an uprising against the government will take place in different parts of the country. If one sees himself with the sun in a dream, and should he be working in the government or the army, it means that he will betray his superior, or the ruler of that land. Otherwise, it means that his condition will deteriorate, and life will turn against him. If the sun has no rays in the dream, it means that the governor or the general of the army will lose respect. If he is an administrator, it means that he will be dismissed from his function. If he is a subject or an employee, it means that he will lose his source of income.

If a traveller sees the sun too bright in a dream, it means that he will return home safely.

If one swallows the sun in a dream, it means distress, sorrow, or death. If the sun rises from the West, then it means defamation, exposing the ills of the person seeing it, or divulging a secret. The rising of the sun from the West also means recovering from an illness, and for a businessman, it means profits from that direction, but in general, it may mean revealing a secret, or it could mean a scandal or death. The same interpretation is given if one sees the sun rising from the South to set in the North. If the sun changes its nature in a dream, it means trouble in that land. If one sits under the sun in a dream, it means that he will receive honour and blessed profits. Grabbing some rays of the sun in a dream means receiving undiminishing wealth.

If one is hiding something, then seeing the sun in his dream means that his secret will be exposed. If one sees the rays of the sun falling over his bed or threatening him in a dream, it means a painful sickness or inflammation of the skin. If the sun rays that are falling over his bed provide him with good energy in the dream, it means a good harvest or good health. If travellers see many suns in the sky in a dream, it means profits and prosperity. Running away from the sun in a dream means that one may leave his wife, or he may run away from the governor of that land, or escape from an evil. If the sun and the moon meet in one's dream, it means a royal marriage, or a marriage between a beautiful woman and a wealthy man. Clouds covering the rays of the sun in a dream mean an illness. If one carries the sun in a bag in a dream, it means money. The sun in a dream also could represent a wise man, or a teacher, one whose company is sought. Otherwise, the sun in a dream could represent the governor, one's husband, wife, child, mother, daughter, aunt, father, or grandfather, and the above interpretations will relate to such a person. Whatever happens to the sun in the dream will then affect such people. If one sees the sun rising, then immediately setting in the same direction in a dream, it means a newborn who may die shortly after his birth, returning an ex-prisoner to jail shortly after his release, earning amazing amounts of money, or repenting from sin, reverting to wrongdoing, the return of a bride to her parent's house immediately after her wedding night, or it could mean reconciliation between husband and wife. If one sees the sun and the moon shining on him in a dream, it means that his parents are pleased with him. If one sees himself prostrating to the sun or the moon in a dream, it means that he will commit an awful sin or a heinous crime. In a dream, the sun also represents one's livelihood, earnings, spiritual guidance, following the truth, new garments, or recovering from a serious illness. Seeing many suns in the sky in a dream means the spread of religious innovations. If the brightness of the sun grows beyond normal to become unbearable in the dream, it means adversities. Eating up the sun in a dream means benefiting from its services and prospering from its rays, or that one may become a man of knowledge, a scholar, an astrologer, or a fortune teller. If the rays of the sun cause burns to someone in a dream, it means that he will fall in love with a beautiful face, or perhaps he will be hurt by someone he adores, or it could mean loss of spiritual direction, or it could be a severe warning about a woman he loves. If a woman sees herself carrying the sun in a dream, it means that she will find a husband or bear a son. If one sees the sun talking to him in a dream, it means that he will discover a mystery or acquire knowledge about spirits, or he could become a translator, an analyst, or a consultant. Seeing the sun, the moon, and the stars together in a dream denotes adversities, jealousy on the part of one's own family, or they could denote fear. If the rays of the sun burn the crop in a dream, it means devastation and a plague, or rising prices. (Also see Eclipse, Heavens)",

If he enters the water of the ocean and then comes back to the shore in a dream, it means that he will commence his path of seeking knowledge, then abandon it. Swimming in a dream also means going to jail. Swimming on sand in a dream means that one may be incarcerated, that his living conditions in his jail will be constricted, and that he will suffer in his prison from hardships equal to the difficulties he encounters during his swim in the dream. If one sees himself swimming inside his own house in a dream, it means that he will work for a ruthless, wicked, and unjust employer who will entrap him in his service through a business deal. Consequently, God Almighty will help him out of his entanglements. If one is afraid of swimming in a dream, it means that he is scared of someone in authority. If he runs away from swimming in a dream, it means that he will escape from him. If one sees himself entering waters where he can swim successfully in a dream, it means that he will engage in a major project, lead an important job, or acquire authority and power. If one swims on his back in a dream, it means that he will repent for a sin. If he swims in the sea and finds its water stagnant in the dream, it means that he will serve someone in authority, though his job will bring him nothing but trouble and the wrath of his employer. If he still manages to cross the sea in his dream, it means that he will escape from the dangers his employment could inflict upon him. If he swims with fear in a dream, it means trouble, imprisonment, or a sickness he will endure, depending on the type of needed efforts or distance he has to cross. Should he think in the dream that he will not be able to make it, then it means his death. If he shows courage during his swim in the dream, it means that he will be able to escape from such a dangerous job. Troubled waters in a dream mean adversities. Swimming successfully across troubled waters in a dream means overcoming one's adversities. Any sea or agitated waters in a dream represent the authorities or the state, whether it be a swamp, a lake, a pond, a sea, or an ocean. If one sees himself drowning in a river or a lake, then if he is carried by others and laid on dry land motionless like a fish in a dream, this also means trials and adversities. If one is saved from drowning before he wakes up from his sleep in the dream, it means that he will triumph over his trials. Otherwise, if he dies from it in the dream, it means that he may die from such adversities. During his swim, he meets a ship that pulls him out of the waters, or to which he holds or grabs, which also means escape from adversities. If one drowns in the dream, it means that he may die as a martyr, though having previously indulged in many sins. To walk on water, whether it is the sea or a river, in a dream, means good spiritual standing, religious assiduousness, and a strong faith and determination.

If a sword is interpreted as power, then it means diligence, and if it is interpreted as words, it means clarity of speech. If it is interpreted as one's father, then it represents the father's pride in his son. If one's sword is weighing heavily and is being dragged with difficulty in the dream, it means an appointment that is difficult to bear, though one will draw benefits from it. If one hands his wife the blade in the dream, it means that she will bear a son. If he hands her the sword sheathed in the dream, it means that she will bear a daughter. An iron sword in a dream represents a son. A brass sword in a dream means a rich son. A lead sword in a dream means an effeminate son. A wooden sword in a dream means a son who is a hypocrite, and a tarnished sword in a dream represents an unattractive son. To draw out one's sword from its sheath in a dream could represent some words one is prepared to say. If the sword is sharpened, bright, and scintillating in the dream, it means that his words will be sweet and true. If it looks rusted or tarnished in the dream, it means that his words will be harsh and false. If the sword is heavy in the dream, it means that he will say words that are even heavy for him to bear. If the sword has a crack in the dream, it means that his words will be rejected, and his intention will be vexed. If one's sword falls to the floor in a dream, it means that one may divorce his wife. If one's sword is seen lying beside him in the dream, it means that he is a man of authority. If the loop or the belt breaks and the sword falls in the dream, it means loss of one's power. If the hilt breaks in the dream, it may mean the death of one's wife. If one is given a sheath without a sword in a dream, it means that he will keep something in trust. If the handle of one's sword breaks in a dream, it means that either one's father, uncle, aunt, or mother may die shortly. If the blade breaks in the dream, it means that one's servant or assistant-worker may die shortly. If one sees swords flying in the air in a dream, they represent a plague. A sword in a dream could also represent one's anger, or his tight financial circumstances. Swallowing a sword in a dream means gathering the spoils of war. If a sword swallows someone in a dream, it means a snakebite. In a dream, the sheath of a sword represents a woman. Hitting someone with a sword in a dream means insulting him with harsh words. Sheathing one's sword in a dream means marriage. If the blade ceases to cut in a dream, it means that one's words will bear no weight. If one is hit with a sword, and if he loses his hand, his leg, or receives wounds in the dream, it means having an argument that involves one's father, son, or brother, etc., depending on which limb and what member of one's family it represents. If one's head is cut off with a sword in a dream, it means that the one who received the blow will triumph over the one who beheaded him, or receive benefits through him. If one's body is dismembered with a sword in a dream, it means that he may travel far, or that his progeny will disperse across the land.

If a woman sees a well in a dream, it means meeting a man of good character. If one sees himself looking into a well in a dream, it means that he is thinking about a particular woman for marriage. A well in a dream is also interpreted to represent knowledge, marriage, a big man, prison, ties, or deception.

If the water gushes forth, rises, and runs outside of an old well in the dream, it represents crying and grief in that place. Digging a well and finding water to channel for one's garden in a dream means taking an herbal remedy to cure one's impotence, or to save his marriage.

Falling into a well in a dream also means demotion, or it could mean travel. Sitting at the edge of a well in a dream means dealing with a deceiving person. A collapsed well in a dream represents a dying woman. Reaching a well that is dug for the general public to draw from its water means getting relief after suffering from difficulties. Finding a well adjacent to a barmaid in a dream means finding a spiritual teacher, or joining a fellowship and a school for the seekers.

It greatly benefits its people. It also may denote the bounty and blessings which are imparted to that town, or it could denote the victory of its people over their real enemy. Drinking from such a well in a dream means fulfillment of one's intentions and satisfaction of his needs. In a dream, a well also means a prison or depression. If one is in such a state, it means that his adversities will dissipate, and that he will reestablish himself in the circles of people in authority. If the person in the dream is a seer who predicts events, then he may be involved in the circles of governors, particularly to interpret their dreams. It is possible that he also might receive emissaries of notable people who will bring him what pleases him. It also could mean a fight in one's family involving jealousy, envy, betrayal, though in the end one will triumph over them.

In that sense, winds in a dream represent the sphere of one's control and his power to change things, or to manoeuvre people's interests. Winds in a dream may also represent a leader, his army, commands, and helpers. Wind was once one of the servants of God's Prophet Solomon, upon whom be peace, as it moved under his command by God's leave. A stormy wind in a dream may represent calamities, destruction, or plagues. A tornado in a dream means destruction or a calamity. On the other hand, wind in a dream may also mean pollination, good harvest, prosperity, victory, or success. However, winds in a dream also represent illness, rheumatism, sneezing, aching, or headaches, etcetera. If one sees the wind carrying him and transporting him from one place to another with no fear on his part, and if there are no clouds or darkness in the skies in the dream, it means that he may preside over people, should he qualify for that, or if he wished to do so, or it could represent his business success, or that he will liquidate his merchandise, should it be stagnant or unsalable. If the winds lift someone who is seized by fear or tyranny, and if the winds carry with them dark clouds, or a cloud of dust in the dream, and if the person is travelling when he sees the dream, it means that he will face great difficulties. If he is ill, then his illness will intensify, or it could mean that some higher order will persecute him, or perhaps a judge will rule against him. If one sees a huge tornado or a tropical storm carrying people, trees, homes, or cattle in the air to scatter them over its path of destruction, then it represents a major plague or a calamity affecting that region. Poisonous winds or polluted air in a dream represent a feverish illness. A stormy wind accompanied by thunder in a dream represents a tyrant. If the wind carries someone from one place to another in the dream, it means that he may travel there, but he may never return to his homeland. A gentle wind or a breeze in a dream represents grace and blessings for the people and the land. A storm of dust in a dream represents destruction in the land. However, winds in a dream always represent tidings from God Almighty. If the wind is not accompanied by a good witness or a cheering element in the dream, then it means cessation of blessings for that land. If the wind is accompanied by a stridulous or a shrill sound in the dream, it means a severe punishment for that place. If a general of an army sees himself leading his soldiers and is preceded by a stormy wind in a dream, it means that he will be victorious and that he will triumph over his enemy. However, if a storm faces him upon his arrival on the battlefield in the dream, it means that he will lose his battle. If one sees a storm uprooting the trees in his dream, it means that the government of that land will mass murder its people. A southern wind in a dream means illness, diseases, or death. A southern wind is sometimes interpreted as rain and prosperity. If one witnesses a slow-moving wind in his dream, it means that he will consent to the actions of a group of evildoing people.

    "meaning": "(Teenage girl) A young girl in a dream represents an enemy, however she may look. Seeing a well-dressed and pleasingly adorned young woman in a dream means hearing pleasing news coming from an unexpected person. Seeing a young and beautiful-looking female servant in a dream means blessings, a favour, joy, and festivities. In a dream, seeing an unknown young girl is more advantageous than seeing a known one. The strongest in meaning are those teenage girls who are presentable, well-mannered, and beautifully dressed. If she is seen dressed modestly in the dream, then she represents goodness, chastity, discretion, and following the correct religious conduct. If she adorns herself and plays up her charms in the dream, then such goodness will be public. If a young girl sees herself as an old woman in a dream, it means that she will live with modesty and preserve her chastity. If an old woman sees herself turned young again in the dream, it means regaining her strength, sexual desire, and fertility. If she engages in lawful sexual intercourse in marriage, it denotes strong religious adherence. If she engages in sexual intercourse with someone without marriage in the dream, then her dream represents her love for the world and attachment to its glitters. If one sees an old woman turned young in a dream, then the above explanation becomes stronger. However, if one is poor, it means that their basic needs will be secured. If one has lost her chances in this world, it means that she will have a new opportunity, or if she is sick, it means that she will recover from her illness. Seeing a young girl frowning in a dream means that one may hear disturbing news. If she looks emaciated, then one's dream denotes poverty. If she is naked in the dream, it means business losses and defamation. Marrying a virgin teenage girl in a dream means wealth. (Also see Little girl)",

    "meaning": "(Well of Zamzam, Kaaba, Mecca) If one sees the well of Zamzam quenching the thirst of people and if it is situated in a particular neighbourhood, or a town other than Mecca, it signifies that a gnostic will come to reside in that place and whose knowledge and wisdom will benefit its people. Drinking water from the blessed well of Zamzam in a dream also means recovering from an illness. If one drinks Zamzam water after having placed an intention in his dream, for example, to acquire knowledge, grow in wisdom, become wealthy, to recover from an illness, to conceive a child, to receive forgiveness for one's sins or any lawful desire in a dream, it means that God willing, one's wish will come true.

    "label": "Zikr",
    "meaning": "(Hymn, Remembrance of God, Songs of God's love, Supplications) If one sees himself in a dream participating in a circle of people remembering God Almighty, or calling upon His most beautiful name, or invoking His divine attributes, or reading the Qur'an, or reciting devotional songs, it means that such a location will be built as a holy place to celebrate God's praises. The goodness of that place depends on the quality of reading, or the degree of devotion seen in the dream. When it is an ascetic song in the dream, it means that one's deputyship is established correctly, but if one sees himself singing a sensual love song, then it means temptations. If one sees himself repeatedly calling God's name in a dream, it means that he will win victory over his enemy. Calling people to God and reminding them of His attributes in a dream represents the work of a preacher who admonishes people, helps them to the shore of safety, and distances them from their sins and their consequences. If a merchant sees himself calling upon God's beautiful names in a dream, it means that his business will be saved from bankruptcy. If a disbeliever, a profane or a secular person sees himself in a state of remembering God Almighty and calling upon His most holy attributes in a dream, it means that he may fall sick, or face great adversities, while in his heart, he will remain pleading with God Almighty for mercy and relief, though he may remain silent in public regarding his inner faith, and in fear of being ridiculed by his circles. If, during his dream, one speaks words of truth and wisdom, it means that he will recover from his adversity and be cured of his illness. Furthermore, he will move into a more comfortable life and begin a life of sharing and doing good deeds in this world, or he may receive guidance and light, and faith will permeate his heart. If one says his prayers with a twang in a dream, it means that he will linger in difficulties, and that people will mock him too. (Also see Supplications)",
