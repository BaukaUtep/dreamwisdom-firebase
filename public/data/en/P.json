If a man sees himself pregnant in a dream, it means that he suffers from heaviness in his life, or it could represent one's fear of exposing his problems in public. In general, pregnancy in a dream represents material gains. If a woman sees herself pregnant in a dream, it means difficulties and adversities, besides some troubling secrets she may be hiding. However, for a learned man, pregnancy in a dream may represent an increase in his knowledge, while for a craftsman, it means achieving unrivalled excellence in his trade. Pregnancy in a dream also means being madly in love, or having passionate attachment to someone, or planting seeds in the wrong place, or being bisexual or a deviate, or suffering from dropsy, or perhaps it could mean that a thief will enter his house to steal something, or to hide a stollen object, or that one may steal something and hide it from its true owner, or that he may get sick from eating spoiled food, or it could mean that he may bury a dear person, or that he is affected and a liar, or he may hide his real beliefs and show a better standing in public, or it may represent an accident or a fire.

In a dream, a woman's pregnancy means wealth, and a man's pregnancy means pain and sorrow. However, generally speaking, pregnancy in a dream could also mean prosperity and material success. The extent of wealth is measured by the number of months of such pregnancy and the size of one's growth in the dream. This is true whether it is a man or a woman in the dream. If a young boy who is under the age of puberty sees himself pregnant in a dream, it represents his father, and if a young girl who is under the age of menstruation sees herself pregnant, then it represents her mother. If a man sees his wife pregnant in a dream, it reflects his desire for material success. If one sees his pregnant wife delivering a baby boy in a dream, it means that she will give birth to a girl, and the opposite may be true, except if it is common for the person in the dream to experience in wakefulness what he sees in his dream. If one sees himself delivering a baby from his mouth in a dream, it means his death, or it could mean that he will use poised and pleasant words in a conversation with someone he is careful not to offend.

If one sees himself incarcerated in a large prison in a dream, it means that he will stand before a strong person who will delegate an important responsibility to him, and from which he will gain spiritual advancement.  If he is incarcerated in an unknown jail, which is built from plaster in a dream, then it represents his grave. If one sees himself locked and tied up inside a house in a dream, it means a positive advancement in his life. If in such a place one sees himself being tortured in a dream, it means that his benefits and profits will be greater. If a woman sees herself imprisoned in a dream, it means that she will marry an important person or an older person. If in one's dream the prison is administered by a religious authority, it means that one correctly adheres to his religion. If it is a civil prison, then it means adversities, sufferings, and distress caused by hypocrisy and by blaming others. An unknown prison in a dream means the world. A prison in a dream also represents an ill-natured wife, a difficult cause, silence, or controlling one's tongue, the perfidy of one's enemy, accusations, allegations, associating with rich people, one's grave, suspension of travels because of an illness, losing one's drive, poverty, or unhappiness. Entering a prison in a dream also means longevity, or reuniting with one's beloved. If one chooses to live in a sanctuary away from people in a dream, it means that they will be protected from sin. If a sick person leaves his prison cell in a dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. If a prisoner sees the gates of his jail open, or if there is a hole in the wall, or a ray of light, or if the ceiling of one's prison disappears and he can see the skies and stars above him, or if he can see them through the walls of his cell in a dream, it means that he will escape from jail. A prison in a dream also represents the safe return of a traveller, or the death of a sick person. If one sees himself imprisoned and tied up by someone in authority in a dream, it represents adversities he wishes to be removed. Walking out of such imprisonment in a dream means relief from such adversities. If one is travelling, it means that he is heedless, and if he is sick, it means that his sickness is a prolonged one. It is also said that imprisonment in a dream may mean that one's prayers are answered and that his difficulties and distress will be removed. If one sees himself incarcerated in an unknown jail of an unknown location and whose dwellers have an uncommon appearance in a dream, such a prison then represents his grave. If a sick person sees himself walking out of an unknown prison, or out of a tiny house into a large open space in a dream, it means that he will recover from his illness and fully enjoy his life. If one sees himself incarcerated in a prison he does not recognize in a dream, it means that he will marry a woman through whom he will prosper and have children. If one sees himself tied up inside his own house in a dream, it means that he will profit and witness blessings that will show in his household members.

In a dream, a prophet also represents a teacher, a tutor, a shaikh, a warning, or glad tidings. If one sees them standing in a stately form, or if one prays behind them, or follows them on the road, or eats something from their delicious food, or drinks from their drink, or if one is anointed with their perfume, or learns something from them, or acquires a particular knowledge from them in a dream, it demonstrates his trueness, faith in God's oneness, following His Messenger and being faithful to his traditions. Otherwise, if one walks before them, or leads them into a narrow lane, or stones them, or mocks them, or argues with them in a dream, it means that he is an innovator and a heedless person. This could also mean that he will be persecuted by his superiors, for a prophet in a dream also represents a ruler or a king, and God's prophets are in truth the guardians of the souls, and they are kings in this world and in the hereafter. A prophet in a dream also represents a religious scholar, because religious scholars are the heirs of the prophets, upon all of them be peace. Religious scholars also know God's prophets better than the common people. They understand their message and follow their traditions of glorifying God's Oneness, devotion, piety, prayers, charity, acting upon what they know, and admonishing others to follow the path of truth and righteousness. A prophet in a dream also represents one's superior, a preacher, a righteous Imam, a conscientious teacher, and a caller to God Almighty. Seeing any of God's prophets looking gracious, stately, and courtly in a dream also represents his people's devotion, or that a major and positive change will take place among his followers. If such a prophet looks spurious, unhappy in a dream, or if he appears in a state that does not befit God's prophets, it means that his followers in the world have deviated from his path and created their own religion, opposing his commands, falsifying and interpreting his message to their liking, and abusing his admonition. If one claims to be a prophet in a dream, it means that he will become known in his field, or if he qualifies, he may become a ruler, a judge, a teacher, or a caller to God Almighty, commanding what is good and forbidding what is evil. Otherwise, it means that he will be afflicted with a great calamity because of a falsehood he fosters, or innovations he practices. If one becomes a messenger in a dream or a caller to God Almighty, and if someone hearkens to him and accepts his message in the dream, it means that he will rise in rank. Otherwise, it means that he will become a broker, a liar, a defrauder, a swagger, depending on his level of knowledge, or it could mean that he will be struck with a major calamity in his life. Such a calamity will be of the same calibre, degree, and nature that a messenger of God Almighty may have suffered from his people. Seeing one of God's prophets in a dream also means living the experience of time, space, and condition in which he saw him in the dream. Wearing the cloak of one of God's prophets in a dream means attaining one's goals, or presiding over people, or acquiring true knowledge. Consequently, one will become renowned, revered, and his opinions will be respected by most people. If one becomes a prophet in a dream, it means that he will die as a martyr, or become poor and be gifted with patience and endurance. He will then be granted victory, and God willing, all his needs will be satisfied. Emulating the devotion of a prophet in a dream means trueness in one's faith, compliance with God's religion, certitude, and determination. Becoming one of God's prophets, upon all of them be peace and blessings, in a dream means commanding good and forbidding evil, suffering from adversities and distress equal to those endured by such a prophet, then one will escape from destruction or humiliation by God's leave and through His subtle kindness. If one sees a prophet suffering from poverty and asking for help in a dream, it means that God Almighty will satisfy all the needs of the person seeing such a dream for the sake of the blessings reserved for that prophet. If one kills a prophet in a dream, it means that he will betray a trust, negate a promise, or deny a covenant. Living in the time of one of God's prophets on earth in a dream means honour, dignity, success, piety, and wealth if one is suited for such gifts. Otherwise, it means that Satan is deceiving him. If a prophet of God Almighty beats a righteous and sincere believer in a dream, it means that he will attain peace and salvation in his life in the hereafter. If a prophet talks to someone in a dream, it means that he will receive blessings, honour, status, knowledge, wisdom, and fame in his life.

Prostrating oneself in a dream also means repenting from sin, feeling regret, salvation, escaping from danger, or receiving pardon. Prostrating during a war in a dream means humiliation before one's enemy, a fight, business losses, or it could mean standing helpless before closed doors. Prostrating oneself before God Almighty on top of a mountain in a dream means vanquishing a strong enemy, while prostrating on top of a hill means submission to a strong man. Prostration in a dream also means faith in God Almighty, joining the company of God's messenger, upon whom be peace, in paradise, longevity, and improving one's spiritual life.
