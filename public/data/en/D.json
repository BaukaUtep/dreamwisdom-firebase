It is also said that if one sees the prophet David in a dream, that his country or town will be governed by a just ruler, an honourable president, or a righteous judge. If the ruler or the judge of that town, county, or country is an unjust person, then seeing God's prophet David in a dream means that God Almighty will surely replace him with a just and honourable one.

This interpretation applies if one is carried on a bier or a litter and his funeral is accompanied by crying and lamentation, except if he is buried in the dream. If one witnesses his burial in the dream, then it means that his case is hopeless and that he will be seized by the world. One's followers or assisting entourage will be as many as those who walk in his funeral in the dream. However, he will conquer people and ride over their shoulders. If one dies in his dream but does not have the look of dead people and there is no crying over his death or a funeral in the dream, it means that one of his properties will be torn down, or that a room in his house will collapse, or that a wall will cave in, or it could mean that a pillar will breakdown. Such a dream may also signify weakness in one's religious standing or blindness of his heart. Despite that, he will live a long life. If one dies in a dream and finds himself looking like a dead person, and if his body is washed and wrapped in a shroud, it also means weakness in his religion. All the sorrow and crying one sees in this case represent his rising in rank and promotion in the world. Death in a dream also signifies travels, or it could mean poverty. One's death and burial in his dream also means that he will die short of repentance. If one comes out of his grave after his burial in the dream, it means that he will repent for his sins before dying.

If one dies and is carried over people's shoulders, though they do not bury him in the dream, it means that he will conquer his enemy, and should he qualify for leadership, he will attain it.

If he sees them drinking from the wells in a dream, it means that a great plague will befall that town. If one sees a deceased person die, then if he walks in his funeral in the dream, it means that someone among his children or in the family of that person will shortly die. If no crying or sorrow follows his death, then it means that someone in his progeny will get married. What a deceased person says about himself in a dream is true, for he has reached the abode of truth, and he can exercise no falsehood in that abode.

If one sees a deceased person well dressed in a white or green garment, smiling and happy in a dream, it means that he is in that state one witnessed in his dream.

If one washes the deceased person's clothes in a dream, it means that the deceased person will become free from his burdens in the hereafter.

If he is sick in the dream, it means that he is answerable to God Almighty for his religious negligence. If the deceased person's face looks dark or opaque in the dream, it means that he died as an unbeliever. If one sees a deceased person sprightly, pleasant, and casual in a dream, it means that one's dream is a mere hallucination, or that he is experiencing disturbed dreams, for dead people do not joke and have their duties to respond to. If one's deceased father or mother comes back to life in a dream, it means relief from distress and the abolishing of his fears. This is particularly stronger when one's deceased mother is seen in the dream. Resurrecting a deceased person in a dream means giving guidance to an unbeliever or admonishing an innovator. This also could mean admonishing heedless people who will repent for their sins. If one sees a deceased person die again in a dream, it means that someone by the same name will shortly die. If a deceased person complains about a migraine headache in a dream, it means that he is being questioned about his religious negligence or his injustices, or his abominable attitude toward his father or mother. If the deceased person complains about his eyes in the dream, it means that he is being questioned about what he owes to his wife or about her dower or about a will or a trust he wasted.

Consequently, he will suffer losses because of it. To have a wedding with a deceased person and to move to his or her house in the dream means one's death.

If a deceased person beats the person seeing the dream, it means that one has displeased his Lord and has committed an abominable act from which he should repent, for in the abode of truth, a deceased person accepts only what pleases God Almighty and dislikes what He dislikes. If one sees a living person beating a deceased person who is willingly submitting to his fate in a dream, it represents the spiritual and religious strength and the rank of the living person, his charities, prayers, devotion, piety, or it could mean that he is fulfilling the deceased person's will.
