If they look dirty, greasy and rough to handle in the dream, then they denote the ill management of one's life or business. If one sees an abacus in such a condition in his dream, it may also represent unsanitary food preparation, a greasy spoon restaurant, or it could mean abating the declared weight or value of a merchandise. An abacus in a dream also may represent a well behaved child, a student, a teacher, or a judge. If one turns into an abacus in a dream, it means an illness or a calamity. An abacus in a dream also means that one's patience, contentment and trust in God Almighty will reserve him a generous reward.

Taking a second ablution to perform one's prayers without the ritual need to do so in a dream means an increase in one's light. Taking ablution with milk or honey in a dream means debts. Ablution is a proper deed in all religions. It is a guard, a clemency, assurance of the divine protection, and immunity from punishment. Taking an ablution to perform one's prayers in a dream means entering under God's protection against what one may fear. It is reported in the traditions that God Almighty has said to Moses, upon whom be peace: \"When you are seized by fear, take your ablution and direct your family to enter the sacrament of prayers.\" Washing one's body in a dream is either performed in preparation for prayers or to wash away impurities. Taking ablution inside a tunnel, or taking a complete ritual bath in a dream, means recovering a stolen object. Taking one's ablution and engaging in prayers in a dream means relief from distress and offering thanks to God Almighty for His protection and guidance. If a merchant sees himself praying without ablution in a dream, it means that he has entered into a business venture without capital. If a worker sees that dream, it means that he has no home to shelter him. If a ruler sees that dream, it means that he has no soldiers to protect him. If a sick person sees himself taking ablution while in bed in a dream, it means separation from his wife or a close friend. Taking ablution inside one's house in a dream means that one will move to a new house. Taking ablution in the street or the marketplace in public or in a bathhouse in a dream means a scandal, loss, and a curse. Taking ablution at the seashore or in a proper ablution area in a dream means dispelling one's fear, sorrow, or distress. Taking ablution while standing over a friend's head in a dream means inheriting him. Seeing a friend taking his ablution over one's head in a dream means suffering harm or a scandal that will be caused by such a friend. Taking ablution in a dream also means dispelling fears, recovering from an illness, paying one's debts, or repenting from sin. Taking ablution with hot water in a dream means falling sick. Wanting to take ablution and failing to find the proper means to perform it in a dream means failure of a project or facing adversities.

Building a house with adobes in a dream means unity and love between the father and his children. If an adobe falls to the ground in a dream, it means the death of a sick person, or disunity in the family, or dispersal of one's children.

If one sees an adulteress soliciting him for fornication in a dream, it means that he might be lured to earn unlawful money. If one commits adultery with a young and beautiful woman in a dream, it means that he will place his earnings in a well-guarded place or a coffer. If a strong person commits adultery in his dream and if he has to face the divine ordinance and chastisement for his sin in the dream, it means that his authority will expand. If the person in the dream qualifies for leadership, then he will be endowed with one. If one sees himself committing adultery with the wife of a close friend in a dream, it means that he will take some money from him. If one reads the ruling of the divine ordinance concerning the punishment of adulterers in a dream, it means that he is an adulterer. If one deals with an adulteress or with a woman who has committed adultery in a dream, then such a woman represents the world and its seekers. If a student on the path of God Almighty, who is known to have piety, good conduct, and who has the look of a believer, sees himself dealing with an adulteress or a woman who has committed adultery in a dream, it means that he will join the company of a gnostic and learn wisdom at his hand. If one sees a man and a woman sitting alone in an intimate setting in his dream, and if he recognizes them, it means that he desires some worldly interests from such a man. If a man sees himself raping a young woman in a dream, it means that he hides his savings in an unknown place. If he is caught after that, and if the divine ordinance is exacted in the dream, his dream means that he will follow the path of knowledge and understanding of religious jurisprudence.

If one does not qualify for it, then walking in the air in his dream means traveling. Hanging in the air between the heavens and the earth in a dream represents a concerned heart and uncertainty about what to do! Falling in the air in a dream means despair or loss of status in wakefulness. Falling in a dream also means relief from distress, wantonness, or satisfying one's needs. Clear, fresh, and pure air in a dream represents a good time to take a trip for business or pleasure. Air in a dream also represents one's desire and passion. Thus, disobeying one's mind, desire, and passion in a dream means entering the heavenly paradise. Following one's desires in a dream means negligence of one's religious duties. Standing up in the air and speaking loudly in a dream means blessings, favours, money, honour, and fame. Sitting in the air in a dream means arrogance and self-deception regarding religious opinions. Building a house up in the air or placing a mat in the air, or raising a tent in the air, means the death of a sick person, and what is built in this case is one's coffin. If a governor sees that dream, it means his dismissal from his office or his death. Seeing that dream after a wedding or after having marital relations with one's wife means mistrust and loss. It also means involvement in an uncouth action, lacking knowledge of the Holy Book and prophetic traditions, because what one has built lacks a foundation.

There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the Al-Seeing Lord. Seeing God in a dream can be interpreted according to one's state of being. If one sees Him in His glory and majesty, without descriptive designation, without ascription of human characteristics to Him, and without depiction or portrayal in the dream, it is an indication of glad tidings for both this world and the hereafter. These blessings may also continue to affect the lives of one's progeny. If one sees Him otherwise in a dream, it means confusion, and particularly if the Almighty Lord does not address him. If an ailing person sees Him in a dream, it means that he will soon die and come to meet Him. If a straying soul sees God Almighty in a dream, it will find guidance. If an oppressed person sees Him, it means that justice will prevail and he will triumph over his oppressors. Hearing God's words without designation represents the imagination of the person in the dream. Perhaps hearing His words in a dream appeases one's heart and increases the person's drive for success. Hearing God's words without seeing Him represents the rising of one's station. If one receives revelations from behind a veil in a dream, it means mental confusion and innovation. This is most true if a messenger comes in one's dream and describes the one who spoke as God. In this case, the dream is a nightmare, because God Almighty cannot be depicted according to human descriptions. If one sees a picture of God in his dream, it means that he is a liar who ascribes images to God Almighty that do not befit His Majesty and Glory. If one hears God Almighty talking to him directly and if he can focus on Him in the dream, it means that he will be encompassed with God's mercy and blessings. If one sees God Almighty in a dream, it means that he will look at His Divine countenance in the hereafter. Seeing God Almighty seated on the Divine Throne in a dream means elevation of one's rank, knowledge, and increase in his wealth. If one sees himself running away to hide from God Almighty in a dream, it means that he will change the course of his devotion into heedlessness. Seeing a veil separating the servant and his Lord in a dream means that one will commit major sins and abominable actions. If one sees his Lord frowning at him, whereby he could not bear the effulgence of God's light, or if he is seized by a shock and immediately commences to repent and pray for forgiveness in the dream, it means that such a person is indulging in abominable actions, and that he is a despicable sinner who follows his mind and desires, and that he is an innovator of religious thoughts who misleads the people. If one hears God Almighty talking to him in a dream, it represents an admonition and a warning to abstain from sin. If one hears God Almighty talking to him in a dream, it also means that one is more assiduous in his recital of the Qur'an. If one hears God Almighty talking to him with words he cannot understand, then if He anoints him and blesses him in the dream, it means that God Almighty will bring him nigh unto Himself and exalt his station. If one sees God Almighty in a form resembling one's father, a brother, or a relative and showing His kindness or blessing him in a dream, it means that he will be afflicted with a calamity and a major illness. If a righteous person sees himself standing before God Almighty in reverence and filled with awe in a dream, it means that mercy will encompass him and help him to further his growth. The same interpretation applies if one sees himself prostrating before Him. If God Almighty speaks to someone from behind a veil in a dream, it can also represent a good worshipper, but if the Divine address takes place without a veil in the dream, it means falling into sin. If God Almighty names someone in his dream with his birth name, then adds another title to it, it means rising in station and rank. If one sees God Almighty angry with him in a dream, it means that his parents are displeased with him. This description includes seeing oneself falling from the sky or the top of a mountain. If a devoted servant sees God Almighty kissing him in a dream, it applies to his growing devotion and reward. Fearing God Almighty in a dream reflects eminence, peacefulness, quiescence, wealth of being, and disregard for material needs.

Thus, having a dream during the month of Muharram could be even called a vision, and it never fails. Such a dream means success, relief from difficulties, release from prison, or recovery from an illness. If the person had retreated from his town, he would return to it. This interpretation is based on the story of God's prophet Jonah, upon whom be peace, after he emerged from the belly of the whale. Perhaps the person in the dream may face a great spiritual challenge in his life, or it could mean the death of a great man of knowledge, or the emergence of such a gnostic or wise man in that city. If the person seeing the dream is a sinner, it means that he will repent of his sins, for God Almighty has accepted the repentance of Adam, upon whom be peace, during that month. If the person in the dream hopes for a station of honour, he will attain it, because God Almighty has raised the Prophet Enoch (Idris), upon whom be peace, to a high station during that month. If a traveller sees a dream during that month, it means that he will safely return home from a long journey, because it is the month in which the Prophet Noah, upon whom be peace, was saved with his people, and it is the month in which the ark settled on top of Mount Judiyyi. If the seer desires a son, then he will beget a righteous son, because it is the month in which God's prophets Abraham and Jesus, upon both of them be peace, were born. If the person seeing the dream is suffering from tight financial circumstances and if he desired a way out, it means that he will see the light or escape from the danger of his enemy, because this is the month in which God's prophet Abraham was saved from the fire of Nimrod, or perhaps, if he had followed a path of innovation and falsehood, he will turn back to God Almighty and repent of his sin, because it is also the month in which God Almighty forgave the prophet David, upon whom be peace. If the person in the dream is impeached from his leadership position or stripped of his status, he will return to his office and regain honour, because it is also the month in which God Almighty returned the Prophet Solomon to his kingdom. If one is bedridden, it means that he will recover from his illness, because it is the month in which the prophet Job recovered from his illness, or perhaps it could mean that one will be sent as an emissary with a mission, or as an ambassador, because it is during this month that God Almighty spoke to His prophet Moses upon whom be peace. As for the second lunar month, known in Arabic as ~afar, having a dream during it could be interpreted as follows: If one is pessimistic about what he saw, then it could mean the opposite. If he is sick, it means recovering from his illness. If one is needy, it means that their needs will be satisfied. If one is suffering from stress and worries, it means that they can cause them no harm. If one sees his dream during the third lunar month, known in Arabic as Rabiul Awwal, and if he is a merchant, it means that his business will grow, prosper, and that his money will be blessed, or perhaps he may conceive a child during that month. If he is under stress and worries, they will be dispelled. If he is persecuted or treated unjustly, he will end in a triumph, or it could mean that he will hear good news, or he may be appointed as a governor, or he may admonish people to do good and discard evil, for it is the month in which God's Prophet Muhammad, upon whom be peace, was born to this world. If one's dream takes place during the fourth lunar month, known in Arabic as Rabiul Thiini, and if it suggests glad tidings, then one may have to wait and exercise patience, but if it suggests evil, then such a happening will come fast. During this month, seeing a dream also means victory over one's enemy, or it could mean conceiving a blessed son who will grow to become a gnostic, or a hero, for it is during this month that the Imam 'Ali, may God bless his countenance and be forever pleased with him, was born. As for the fifth lunar month, known in Arabic as Jamiul Awwal, seeing a dream during this month means that one should slow down or scrutinize his buying and selling, or it could mean that he may lose his daughter or wife, for it is in this month that the daughter of God's Messenger, upon whom be peace, Fatima died. May God be forever pleased with her. If the dream happens during the sixth lunar month, known in Arabic as Jamadu Thaw, and if the dream carries a good meaning, it will come, but slowly, and one should not contradict it. If one sees this dream during the seventh lunar month, known in Arabic as Rajab, it means that he will gain honour and status, for it is the month of the Prophet's Ascension (Miraj) and his night journey to the seventh heaven. A dream during the eighth lunar month, known in Arabic as Sha'ban, represents honour and ranks, for during this month, every good deed will be honoured. As for the ninth lunar month, known in Arabic as Ramadan, in it, all difficulties will be suspended, evil will be shunned, and stinginess will be dispelled. During this month, all that is good will manifest, and bad dreams will dissipate to become null and void. During this month, the dreams of a believer may be differently interpreted than the dreams of a disbeliever. If one sees the month of Ramadan in his dream, his dream means blessings, profits, commanding good and forbidding evil. If the person is seeking knowledge, then knowledge will be given to him, for it is during this great month that the Holy Qur'an was revealed. If the person is afflicted with epilepsy, he will recover from it, for the devils and all evil spirits are shackled and are rendered powerless during this month. As for the tenth lunar month, known in Arabic as Shawwal, if one's dream suggests a war or a conflict, it means that he will come first in it, and that he will triumph. If one sees the month of Shawwal in his dream, it means that he will come out of difficulties and find happiness and devotion, for it is the month during which God's House, known as the Kaaba, was built. As for the eleventh lunar month, known in Arabic as Zul-Qi ‘dah, if one's dream suggests a trip, then the person should refrain from taking that trip, or perhaps he should delay it for the better. He should also guard himself where he lives. If the dream denotes stress or worries, then he should avoid whatever may cause them. However, if one's dream takes place during the twelfth lunar month, known in Arabic as Zul-Hijja indicates a journey, then one may take it, or if it denotes a good business, one should seek it, for it is a most blessed month and it is the month of festivities and sacrifices. If one sees this month in his dream or sees himself offering sacrifices in it, or if he sees himself praying the festival of Sacrifice prayers in it, his dream means paying one's debts or fulfilling one's vows, repentance from sin, guidance or perhaps his dream may indicate the death of great people of knowledge, the impeachment of governors, the changing of governments, or it could mean a sudden war."}, {"id": "arafat", "label": "Arafat", "category": "Earth", "meaning": "(Mecca, Mount 'Arafa, Mount of mercy, Plain of 'Ararat, Reunion of beloveds) If one sees himself standing in prayers in the Plain of 'Arafat during the pilgrimage season on the 9th day of the Arabic month Zul-Hijja, it means the return of a long-awaited traveller to his home, a happy reunion, a family reunion, reconciliation between friends, or peace between two individuals. Seeing Mount 'Arafa or the Plain of ‘Arafat in a dream also could represent the pilgrimage season, or performing a pilgrimage, visiting Mecca on 'Umrah (See 'Umrah), or it could mean the Friday congregational prayers, the sixth day of the week, a marketplace, or engaging in a profitable business. Seeing oneself standing at 'Arafat in a dream also means rising in station, changing conditions, reversal of one's state from good to bad or from bad to good, or perhaps it could mean the death of a beloved, such as one's wife, or it could mean relocating to a blessed place or finding a sanctuary. Seeing oneself at 'Arafat in a dream also could mean losing a battle to one's adversary, though the results or consequences of such a battle will bring him honour and exalted station, or it could mean winning the battle against one's enemy. If a sinner sees himself praying and repenting at Mount 'Arafa or near the Mount of Mercy in the Plain of ‘Arafat in a dream, it means that his repentance will be accepted, or that a secret will be exposed, or it could mean that a reunion of beloveds will take place shortly after one's dream. If one sees himself standing in 'Arafa during the nighttime in a dream, it means that his goals will be attained and that he will satisfy his quest. If one sees himself standing in 'Arafa after the sunrise, it means that his question will find no answer.

If the archangel Gabriel greets someone in his dream, it means that such a person will become a great man of knowledge, and he will be recognized and distinguished in his field.

Seeing him in a dream also signifies the smooth rising of the soul after death for someone who is dying.
