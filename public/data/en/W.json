A well in a dream is also interpreted to represent knowledge, marriage, a big man, prison, ties, or deception. If one digs a well and finds water in it in his dream, it means that he will marry a wealthy woman whom he will deceive. If the water gushes forth, rises, and runs outside of an old well in the dream, it represents crying and grief in that place. Digging a well and finding water to channel for one's garden in a dream means taking an herbal remedy to cure one's impotence, or to save his marriage.

Drinking from such a well in a dream means fulfillment of one's intentions and satisfaction of his needs. In a dream, a well also means a prison or depression. If one is in such a state, it means that his adversities will dissipate, and that he will reestablish himself in the circles of people in authority. If the person in the dream is a seer who predicts events, then he may be involved in the circles of governors, particularly to interpret their dreams. It is possible that he also might receive emissaries of notable people who will bring him what pleases him.

If the winds lift someone who is seized by fear or tyranny, and if the winds carry with them dark clouds, or a cloud of dust in the dream, and if the person is travelling when he sees the dream, it means that he will face great difficulties.
