If the staff of a governor, or a leader, or a manager is broken in a dream, it means that he will lose his post. If he is a merchant, it means that he will lose his business. If one sees himself hitting the ground with his staff in a dream, it means that he will have control over that land, preside over its people, or triumph over the landlord.

A stairway in a dream could also represent the days of one's life and their term. If one sees a staircase that he recognizes in the dream, it could represent the servant of a house, its owner, or its accountant. If a sick person sees himself climbing an unknown staircase which is leading him to the upper room from where he can see paradise in the dream, it means that he may die from his illness and reach what he saw. If obstacles hinder his way or impede his climb in the dream, it means that he is detained, and the immediate blessings of such a gift will be veiled from him. Descending a staircase in a dream means arriving from a journey, resigning from a job, impeachment, or it could represent a pedestrian. If one's descent leads him to his family, house, or farmland in the dream, it means money. If what he reaches at the end of the staircase is unknown, and if one meets people, or souls, he does not recognize in the dream, it also denotes what we have earlier explained. If during one's climb or descent he falls into a well, or if a giant bird grabs him and flies away with him, or if a beast devours him, or if he steps into a boat that sails away as he steps into it, or if he takes a step to find himself riding an animal, or a vehicle of some type, the staircase then represents the stages of one's life and what he encountered during the journey of his life, all replayed or screened before his eyes at the point of descending into his grave, or as a book one reads after his death. If he does wake up and finds himself healthy and fit, it means that he will become a tyrant, an unjust person, an atheist, and a reprobate. If one sees himself descending a staircase that leads him into a mosque, lush foliage, green fields, a fresh breeze of spring, or into a pond to take a ritual ablution to perform his prayers in the dream, it means that he will become a true believer, repent for his sins, and abandon his blameworthy conduct. Otherwise, if he descends upon adverse elements such as snakes, lions, steep hills, corpses, or a field of scattered remains in a dream, then it represents major trials and adversities. If the steps are made of clay in one's dream, they indicate positive signs. However, a stairway could be regarded as unfavourable if its steps are made of backed bricks. If they are made of stones in the dream, they mean business success, along with a heart like a stone. If the staircase is made of wooden steps in the dream, it means reaching a high rank, which is compounded with hypocrisy. If they are made of gold in the dream, then they mean achieving success and gaining authority. If they are made of silver in the dream, they represent one's entourage and attendants. Climbing a staircase in a dream also means sharpening one's intellect and awareness. In a dream, a stairway is also interpreted to mean leading a life of ascetic detachment and devotion. Coming near a staircase in a dream also means attaining success and a growing piety. Each step represents a different station. Climbing a staircase in a dream also represents the dangers one may have to cross. Seeing a staircase with five steps in a dream represents the five time prayers, or the pulpit where the Imam stands to deliver his Friday sermon.

If the stars are gathered in one's house, and if their light is dimmed in the dream, it means that such people will secretly meet in that house under constraint, or because of a calamity. Holding a star in one's hand in a dream means begetting a noble son who will grow to be a great leader. Stealing a star in a dream means stealing a valuable thing. Seeing a star falling from the sky in a dream means that a calamity will befall that place, and it will particularly affect the life of a great and noble person, or it could mean the death of the governor of that town.

Seeing many stars inside one's house in a dream may also signify having a large family. Seeing the seven major stars, or the fixed stars of the solar system, in a dream represents the trades, businesses, knowledge, and leadership in the land. Each of such stars brings a different luck. Seeing a brilliant star in a dream means happiness and leadership. If a rich person sees the skies without stars in a dream, it means loss of his wealth. If a poor person sees the skies without stars in a dream, it means his death. Holding little stars in one's hand in a dream means acquiring fame and presiding over people. Seeing a star over one's head in a dream means becoming renowned and surpassing one's associates, or it could mean serving in a high-ranking position. If one sees brilliant stars gathering in one place in his dream, it means that he will reap benefits from a business trip, or safely return home from such a successful business trip. Riding a star in a dream means leadership, strength, and wealth. If one sees the stars fixed under his roof in a dream, it means a calamity, or destruction of one's house, or it could mean the death of the head of the household. Eating stars in a dream means swindling people of their money. Swallowing a star in a dream means mixing with noble people and sharing one's personal life with them, or it could mean insulting or slandering the companions of God's Prophet, upon whom be peace. Sucking on a star in a dream means learning at the hands of great scholars or a wise shaikh. If a fortune-teller or an astrologer sees himself eating stars in a dream, it means that he will be selected to fill an important job from which he will prosper. As for the majority of people, eating stars in a dream means death. Seeing the stars scattered in a dream means the death of great leaders or scholars, or it could mean a war. Seeing the stars falling on earth, then disappearing, or the lights of meteors entering the earth's atmosphere in a dream, represents great destruction and death. The falling of small stars in a dream signifies the death of unknown people and the meek ones, while the falling of large stars represents the death of renowned people. Seeing the stars falling from the sky could also mean becoming bald or losing one's hair. Whereby, the stars represent one's hair and the skies represent one's head. Seeing the stars during the daytime in a dream means scandals, notoriety, or major events and calamities. Seeing the morning stars in a dream means a wedding. Becoming a star in a dream means acquiring wealth and fame.

If it is a carved wooden statue in the dream, it means that he ingratiates himself with rich people, or with an unjust person in authority, through his religion. If the statue is built from wood in the dream, it means that one seeks religious arguments or disputes. If the statue is made of silver in the dream, it means that one elicits a sexual relationship with his servant, or with a foreign woman, or perhaps just a friendship. If the statue is made of gold in the dream, it means that one may commit an abominable action, or a religious inequity, or seek profits from someone at the expense of displeasing God Almighty, and consequently, one will suffer financial losses or health problems. If the statue combines mixed materials of bronze, copper, steel, iron, or lead in the dream, it means that such a person uses his religious garb to make profits, and that he often forgets about his Lord. A statue in a dream also means travels. Seeing a golden or a silver statue in a dream could also mean prosperity. Seeing a bronze statue of a young woman moving around in a dream means a good harvest, prosperity, or travels. If the statue is bigger than life-size, then it means a fright. Statues in a dream also represent one's children, his sexual drive, or his determination. If one sees himself worshiping a statue in a dream, it means that he is engaged in falsehood, giving preference to his desires and passions over obeying his Lord's commands. If one sees himself worshiping a golden statue in a dream, it means that he will solicit business from someone who worships God Almighty, though he will also suffer losses from such an association. It also means that he will lose his investment, and it will show the weakness of his faith. If one sees himself worshiping a statue made of silver in the dream, it means that he uses his religion to make business out of it, or to betray others through it, or that he will solicit the help of someone to do evil, or that he may sexually abuse a young girl who trusts his religious appearance. If one sees a statue and does not associate it with worship, or if he does not see anyone worshiping it in his dream, his dream then represents financial gains. A statue in a dream also means to be enamored with a woman or a boy. Statues in a dream also could mean deafness, idiotic behaviour, dumbness, attachment to anything in this world, making an idol out of it, such as one's love and attachment to his position, status, business, wife, beloved, house, or child, etcetera.

If one sees the sun rising, then immediately setting in the same direction in a dream, it means a newborn who may die shortly after his birth, returning an ex-prisoner to jail shortly after his release, earning amazing amounts of money, or repenting from sin, reverting to wrongdoing, the return of a bride to her parent's house immediately after her wedding night, or it could mean reconciliation between husband and wife. If one sees the sun and the moon shining on him in a dream, it means that his parents are pleased with him. If one sees himself prostrating to the sun or the moon in a dream, it means that he will commit an awful sin or a heinous crime. In a dream, the sun also represents one's livelihood, earnings, spiritual guidance, following the truth, new garments, or recovering from a serious illness. Seeing many suns in the sky in a dream means the spread of religious innovations. If the brightness of the sun grows beyond normal to become unbearable in the dream, it means adversities. Eating up the sun in a dream means benefiting from its services and prospering from its rays, or that one may become a man of knowledge, a scholar, an astrologer, or a fortune teller. If the rays of the sun cause burns to someone in a dream, it means that he will fall in love with a beautiful face, or perhaps he will be hurt by someone he adores, or it could mean loss of spiritual direction, or it could be a severe warning about a woman he loves. If a woman sees herself carrying the sun in a dream, it means that she will find a husband or bear a son. If one sees the sun talking to him in a dream, it means that he will discover a mystery or acquire knowledge about spirits, or he could become a translator, an analyst, or a consultant. Seeing the sun, the moon, and the stars together in a dream denotes adversities, jealousy on the part of one's own family, or they could denote fear. If the rays of the sun burn the crop in a dream, it means devastation and a plague, or rising prices.

Swimming successfully across troubled waters in a dream means overcoming one's adversities.

Otherwise, if he dies from it in the dream, it means that he may die from such adversities. During his swim, he meets a ship that pulls him out of the waters, or to which he holds or grabs, which also means escape from adversities. If one drowns in the dream, it means that he may die as a martyr, though having previously indulged in many sins.
