Otherwise, if one sees himself looking at a garden, and if he is unmarried, it means that he will meet a suitable woman and get married. If he is married, it means that he will receive joy from his wife equal to that which he received from the garden in his dream. If one finds within such a garden a group of associates or colleagues, the garden then represents a marketplace. If one sees a servant or a worker of his urinating inside a well or a stream inside such a garden in the dream, it means that a relative will betray the interests of the family. A garden whose owner is known in a dream represents a mosque, a park, people of knowledge, ignorant people, the generous ones, or the stingy ones.

A woman wearing a thin garment in a dream represents her integrity, while if she is wearing a thick garment, it represents her labour and hardships.

If one's new garment is torn and cannot be repaired in the dream, it means the inability to bear children. If the garment can be repaired in the dream, it means that there is an evil spell over the person wearing it. Wearing two torn garments in a dream means death. A torn garment in a dream also means a shattered religious or spiritual life, or it could mean that one is pursued by an evil person, or it could mean poverty or striving to satisfy one's basic material needs.

If a man sees himself wearing a woman's outfit in the dream, and if in his consciousness he intended to act effeminately, it means that he will face a calamity and carry a great burden. If he thinks in his dream that he is a woman, then his humiliation will be greater. Receiving used garments, but in good condition, as a gift in a dream means money, though if they are in bad condition, they mean trouble.

Seeing water flowing through gutters without rainfall in a dream means corruption, or people who are spreading evil in that locality. Each gutter in such a dream also represents the loss of one life. Gutters in a dream also represent servants and housekeepers who faithfully manage their duties, or they could mean relief from distress or pressures. A gutter in a dream may also represent a trustworthy emissary or a reliable letter carrier. If blood flows through a gutter in a dream, then it represents a tyrant and bloodshed that will take place in that locality. If fresh water flows through it, and if people seem to benefit from it in the dream, then it represents economic growth, peace, safety, and tranquillity. If murky water or odorous and filthy water flows through it in a dream, it means plagues that include ulcers, tumours, and smallpox.

Standing under the Gutter of Mercy at the Holy Kaaba in a dream means that one's wishes will come true, and particularly if pure fresh water pours through it. However, if murky water comes through it, then it means the opposite. (Also see Gutter, Kaaba, Zamzam)"}]
