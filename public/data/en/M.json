God's House, Mosque, Place of worship) In Arabic, the word masjid means a place of prostration, while the word Jami means a place of gathering. A masjid or a mosque in a dream represents a scholar, and its gates represent men of knowledge and the guardians, or the attendants of God's House. Building a masjid in a dream means emulating the traditions of God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, fostering the unity of one's family, or becoming a judge, should one qualify for such an office. A masjid filled with people in a dream represents a gnostic, a man of knowledge and wisdom, or a preacher who invites people to his house, advises them, brings their hearts together, teaches them the precepts of their religion, and explains the wisdom behind the divine revelations. Seeing a masjid being demolished in a dream means that such a gnostic, or religious scholar and devout believer, will die in that locality. In a dream, if the roof of a masjid caves in, it means that one will indulge in an abominable action. If one sees a stranger performing his prayers in a masjid in a dream, it means that the Imam of that masjid will die from a terminal illness. If one enters a masjid in the company of a group of people, and if they dig a small hole for him inside the masjid in the dream, it means that he will get married. If one's house becomes a masjid in a dream, it means that he will attain piety, purity of heart, ascetic detachment, and an honour he will receive from his brethren. He will also call upon them to follow what is true and to abstain from what is false. If a masjid is transformed into a bathhouse in a dream, it means that a chaste person will turn corrupt or become heedless. A masjid in a dream also represents a marketplace or a business. If one has to climb up a staircase to reach the masjid in a dream, then the masjid represents a thrifty person who does not like to share what he has. If one has to climb down a staircase to reach the masjid in a dream, it means that his needs will be satisfied. If a masjid in the city is moved to a remote village in a dream, it means stagnation of one's business, being ostracized from one's community, or it could mean legal complications related to one's inheritance. If a ruler builds a house for God Almighty or a masjid in a dream, it means that he will be a just ruler and he will govern his subjects by the divine laws. If a religious scholar builds a masjid in a dream, it means that he will author a book that will benefit others, or deliver a commentary on a complex religious issue, or, if he is wealthy, it means that he will pay the alms tax due on his assets. Building a masjid in a dream also means getting married, or conceiving a child who will grow to become a righteous and knowledgeable scholar, or if one is poor, it means that he will become rich. Otherwise, it means that one will serve God's House and fill it with invocations, supplications, serving the interests of the community, leading the people to unity and love, and teaching them to value obedience to God's commands. Building a masjid in a dream also could mean becoming a real estate agent, or repenting from one's sins, or receiving guidance on God's path, or to die as a martyr, hence, what one builds for God Almighty in a dream represents his house in paradise. Such interpretation applies if one builds a masjid following the proper procedures and with lawfully earned money, and using proper materials. Otherwise, building it with what is unlawful of money or materials in the dream, or changing the direction of the prayer niche, etc., then one's dream will carry the opposite meaning. If one builds a masjid or a fellowship house in a dream, it means that he will seek the path of knowledge and wisdom, or that he will attend a pilgrimage during that same year, or establish a permanent business, such as a hotel, a bathhouse, or a shop, etcetera. Building the roof of a masjid in a dream means taking care of orphans or sponsoring homeless children. Expanding a masjid in a dream means an increase in one's good deeds, repentance from a sin, adopting good conduct, or being just. Seeing oneself inside a new masjid one does not recognize in a dream means attending the pilgrimage to God's House in Mecca during that same year, or joining religious circles to learn about one's religion. If one's shop becomes a masjid, or if the masjid becomes a shop in the dream, it denotes lawful earnings, or it could mean mixing lawful and unlawful earnings. A forsaken masjid or mosque in a dream means intentionally ignoring the value of gnostics and religious scholars, or denying the necessity to command what is good and to eschew what is evil. A forsaken masjid in a dream also denotes the presence of ascetics who have renounced the world and its people and care less about their material possessions. A known mosque in a dream represents the city where it is erected. For instance, the Aqsa mosque in a dream represents Jerusalem, the Sacred mosque represents Mecca, the Prophet's Mosque represents Medina, the Omayyad mosque represents Damascus, Al-Azhar mosque represents Cairo, and the Blue mosque represents Istanbul, etcetera. A known mosque in a dream also could represent the renowned scholars who live in that place, or the ruler of that country, or any of his ministers. If one enters a mosque and immediately after crossing the entrance gate, he prostrates himself to God Almighty in the dream, it means that he will be allowed to repent for his sins. If one comes to a masjid and finds its doors locked, then if someone opens the door to him in a dream, it means that he will help someone in paying his debt, then extol his good virtues in public. If one enters a mosque riding on an animal in a dream, it means that he will cut off his connection with his relatives, leave them behind, and forbid them to follow him. If one dies in a masjid in a dream, it means that he will die as a true penitent. If the carpet or the straw mat of a mosque becomes a shredded rag in the dream, it means that the community of that masjid is divided and corrupt. Building a masjid in a dream also means overcoming one's enemy. Entering the Sacred Mosque in Mecca in a dream means arriving with one's bride to their new home, and it could mean fulfillment of a promise, being truthful, dispelling one's fear, and reaching the shores of safety.

(Also see Jar, Tankard)"}, {"id": "muhammad", "label": "Muhammad", "category": "Prophets", "meaning": "(God's Prophet Muhammad, blessings and peace be upon him, The Seal of the prophets, The last Messenger) It is related that God's Messenger, upon whom be peace, has said: \"One who sees me in a dream will see me in his wakefulness, for Satan cannot impersonate me. \"He also has said: \"One who sees me in a dream, it is as if he has truly seen me, for Satan cannot impersonate me. \" He also has said: \"One who sees me in a dream will not enter the fire of hell.\" Muslim theologians and scholars differ in opinion about the meaning of seeing God's Prophet in a dream. Imam Ibn Seerin used to ask someone who tells of such a dream to describe the Prophet, upon whom be peace. If any of the details did not fit his description, Ibn Seerin's reply was: ''You have not seen him.\" Asim Bin Kulayb once said: \"I related to Ibn Abbas, God bless his soul and that of his father, that I saw God's Prophet in a dream. Ibn Abbas replied: \"Describe him to me.\" Asim Bin Kulayb added: \"I described him as resembling Al-Hassan son of 'Ali, upon both of them be peace.\" Ibn Abbas replied: \"Indeed, you have seen him.\" Ibn 'Arabi once explained that the essence of seeing God's Prophet is cognizance of his presence and understanding the reality of his character and example. Thus, recognizing the presence of the blessed being is an affirmation of the truth, while seeing the physical form represents his example and attributes, for being earthly does not change the essence of prophethood. When God's Prophet said, \"He will see me in wakefulness,\" it means: 'Expounding upon what he saw,' for what one sees in such a dream is the truth which resides in the realms of the unseen. In the second saying, when God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, said: \"It is as if he has truly seen me,\" it means that if one had seen him during the time of delivering God's message, the example will be the same. Thus, the first saying signifies what is real and true, while the second saying implies the physical reality and its example. If one sees God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, coming toward him in a dream, it means blessings and benefits, and if one sees God's Prophet turning away from him in a dream, it means the opposite. AI-Qadi Iyad, God bless his soul, interpreted the words of God's Prophet in his saying: \"Has truly seen me,\" to mean: \"has truly seen my physical form,\" that the blessed companions knew, while seeing him in another form in a dream means that one's dream connotes personal interpretations. Following the explanation of AI-Qadi Iyad, Imam Al-Nawawi commented by saying: \"This is a weak explanation. A stronger interpretation is to say that one who sees God's Prophet in a dream has seen him in reality, however, his resemblance may appear. Whether the resemblance in the dream is known or not.\" In a separate commentary, Shaikh Al-Baqlani added: \"What AI-Qadi Iyad has said does not contradict what Imam Al-Nawa has said.\" This is because the first dream does not require interpretation, according to AI-Qadi Iyad. In the second type of dream, which is discussed in Imam Al-Nawawi's comments, one's dream does require interpretation or analysis. This means that since no Satan can impersonate God's Prophet, then whatever appearance he displays in one's dream is true. The meaning of God's prophet's saying: \"For Satan cannot impersonate me,\" implies that since God's guardianship (Isma) is inviolable, and since God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, is sacrosanct, then as he was protected during the time of delivering God's message to humanity, he is still protected by the same guardianship after God Almighty took him back to Himself. Thus, whoever sees God's Prophet in any appearance in a dream, it is as if they have seen him in reality, regardless of whether one sees him as a young man, or at the time of delivering his message, or as an old person. If one sees him looking old in a dream, it means peace. If one sees him looking young in a dream, it means war. If one sees him smiling in a dream, it means that one is truly emulating his traditions. Seeing God's Prophet in his known and recognized appearance in a dream means that the one seeing the dream is a pious person, that his integrity is inviolable, and that his success is unquestionable. Seeing him in a dream, frowning, represents the ill state of the one seeing the dream. Ibn Abi Jumrah once said, \"Seeing Him in a beautiful appearance denotes the good religious standing of the person seeing the dream. Seeing him with some disfeatures in a dream, a deficiency or distortion in one's application of his religious duties, for God's Prophet is like a mirror that portrays the one standing before it.\" In this sense, the person seeing the dream can recognize their state. This interpretation is also given by Ibn Hajar Al-Hutaymi, God bless his soul. Like that, in the book of Sharh al-Shama-il of Imam Al-Tirmithi, it is also stated that Satan cannot impersonate God Almighty, His signs, prophets, or angels. If someone suffering from distress sees God's Prophet in a dream, it means that his difficulties will be removed. If a prisoner sees him in a dream, it means that he will be released from prison. If one is living at a time of economic chaos, and if high prices are exploiting the people of the land, or if injustice is tyrannizing everyone, then seeing God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, in a dream represents an end to such adversities. Seeing him in his beautiful, radiant, and impeccable appearance, as best described by his companions in a dream, means glad tidings of attaining a successful conclusion to one's life in this world and in the hereafter. The state and clarity of one's heart and how well polished his mirror is determine in what appearance he may see him, upon whom be peace. If God's Prophet comes toward someone in a dream, or leads him in prayers, or if one sees himself accompanying him on the road, or if one eats something sweet from his blessed hand, or receives a cloak, or a suitable shirt, or if God's Prophet promises him something, or prays for him, then if the one seeing the dream qualifies for leadership, and if he is a righteous and a just man who commands what is good and forbids what is evil, and if he is learned and practices what he knows, and if he is a pious worshipper and a devout Muslim, he will then attain the station and company of the blessed ones. If the one who sees the dream is a disobedient servant of God Almighty, it means that he will repent for his sins and return to his Lord. If he is living in heedlessness, it means that he will be guided. Perhaps, he might attain his goals in acquiring knowledge, or learn how to reconstruct his innermost being to befit a human being who is grateful to his Lord. If one fears oppression, persecution, or loss of his property and wealth, seeing him in a dream, it means putting an end to such fears, for he is the best of intercessors to restore anyone before God Almighty. If one who follows innovations sees God's Prophet in a dream, it means that he should fear God Almighty, heed His warnings, and correct himself and particularly if he sees Him walking away from him, or turning his back to him. Seeing God's Prophet in a dream also means receiving glad tidings and happy news, or it could signify justice, establishing the truth, fulfillment of a promise, reaching a high rank among the members of one's family, or perhaps it could mean that one may suffer from their envy and jealousy, or leave his homeland and migrate to another country, or it could mean that he may lose his parents and become an orphan. Seeing him in a dream also could mean seeing miraculous events (Karamat), for his companions witnessed and testified to a deer greeting him, a camel who kissed his foot, the broiled leg of mutton talking to him, trees moving to give him cover, pebbles glorifying God's praises in his hand, among countless miracles, including his Nocturnal Journey and ascension (Miraj) to the heavens to meet his Lord. If an ophthalmologist sees him in a dream, it means that he will acquire great expertise in his field and become renowned in the land, for God's prophet upon whom be peace, did return the eye of his companion Qutadah to its place and made his sight sharper than it was by God's leave, after Qutadah had lost his eye during one of the battles with the unbelievers. If a traveller in the desert sees God's Prophet in a dream, or if there is drought somewhere, it means that rain will fall and springs will gush forth, as water gushed from between his blessed fingers when he placed his blessed hand over a half-filled cup to quench the thirst of an entire army. If calamities, starvation, and drought have befallen a land and someone sees Him in a dream, it means that such calamities will be lifted and life will return to normal in that place. If a woman sees him in a dream, it means that she will reach a high spiritual station, honour, righteousness, chastity, trustworthiness, and perhaps be given a blessed progeny, or if she is wealthy, it means that she will spend her wealth on God's path. Seeing him in a dream also means facing adversities, bearing patience, and suffering from one's enemy. If an orphan sees him in a dream, it means that he will reach an exalted station, and the same goes if a foreigner sees him in his dream. If a physician sees him in a dream, it means that people will benefit from his medicine. Seeing him in a dream also means victory over one's enemy, or consolidating and paying one's debts, or recovering from an illness, or attending a pilgrimage to God's House in Mecca, or triumphing over one's trials, or cessation of one's adversities, or fertility of a barren land, or the pregnancy of a barren woman. If a visitor to his mosque sees himself in a dream coming before God's Prophet and finds him standing up, it denotes one's correct religious standing, and it means that he will have commanding authority over the Imam of his time. If one finds him deceased in the dream, it means that a noble person from the family of the person seeing the dream will shortly die. If one sees the funeral of God's Prophet in a dream, it means that a calamity will befall that country. Following his funeral procession up to his grave in a dream means that the person seeing the dream will yield to innovations. Visiting his grave in a dream means receiving a great treasure. If one sees himself as the son of God's Prophet in a dream, and even if one is not one of his descendants, it denotes one's sincerity, true faith, and certitude. Seeing God's Prophet by one person does not exclude the remainder of the believers, but the blessings encompass all of them. Receiving something from him, such as food or a drink, in a dream means benefits and profits. If one receives food whose substance connotes negative circumstances, such as a melon or the like elements in a dream, it means that one will escape from a great danger, though he will toil and suffer from hardships during his trials. If one sees that one of the limbs that belongs to God's Prophet has become his own in a dream, it means that he is following innovation and making changes in the laws God's Prophet brought to humankind. If one sees himself in a dream embodying the form of God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, or wearing one of his garments, or receives his ring, or sword, then if the person is seeking to govern, he will attain that and the people will accept his leadership. If one is suffering from persecution or humiliation in the land, then seeing God's Prophet standing in a dream means that God Almighty will grant him victory and make him rise above his enemies. If one is poor, his needs will be satisfied, or if he is unmarried, he will get married. If one sees him in a ruined place in a dream, it means that such a place will be rebuilt. If one enters a room and finds him sitting there in a dream, it means that a miraculous sign, or a major event, will take place in such a locality. If one sees him making the call to prayer in a dream, it means that prosperity will spread in that place. If one sees him establishing the prayers in a dream, it means that the Muslims will reunite and dispel their differences. If one sees him placing kohl over his eyelids in a dream, it means that he will find safety and correct his religious stand, or it could mean that one will study and become a scholar in the field of the prophetic sayings. If a pregnant woman sees him in a dream, it means that she will give birth to a son. If one sees him having a black beard with no grey hair in it in a dream, it will bring happiness, joy, and prosperity to one's life. If God's Prophet is seen as an old man in a dream, it means strength in one's life and victory over one's enemy. Seeing him in his most exalted state in a dream means that the Imam, or the ruler of the country, will rise in station and that his authority will expand. If one sees his blessed neck wide, it means that the Imam is holding firmly to his trust. If one sees him having a large chest in a dream, it means that the Imam or the ruler of the country is generous toward his subjects. If one sees his blessed stomach empty in a dream, it means that the treasury of the country is empty. If one sees his right hand closed in a dream, it means that the Imam or the ruler of the country does not pay his employees, or distribute the collected alms tax. If one sees his blessed right hand open in a dream, it denotes the generosity of the ruler and his compliance with the distribution of charities and alms tax as prescribed in God's book. If his hands are locked together in a dream, it means complications in the life of the Imam, or the ruler of the country. The same will affect the life of the person seeing the dream, including suffering from distress and adversities. If one sees his blessed leg beautiful and hairy in a dream, it means that one's clan will become stronger, and his tribe will grow. If one sees the blessed thighs of God's Prophet tall in a dream, it denotes longevity of the Imam or the ruler of the country. If one sees him standing amid soldiers and everyone is laughing and joking in a dream, it means that the Muslim army will be defeated and humiliated in a war. If he is seen with a small army that is ill-equipped and everyone is looking down in the dream, it means that the Muslim army will triumph in that year. If one sees him combing his blessed hair and beard in a dream, it means that one's distress and adversities will be dispelled. Seeing him in his mosque, or any mosque, or his usual place in a dream, it means gaining power and honour. If one sees him standing amid his companions delivering a revelation in a dream, it means that one will acquire greater knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual understanding. Seeing the grave of God's Prophet in a dream means prosperity and profits for a merchant, or the release of a prisoner from jail. Seeing oneself in a dream as the father of God's Prophet means that one's faith will diminish and his certitude will weaken. If a woman sees herself in a dream as one of the wives of God's Prophet, it represents her growing faith. If one sees him looking into one's affairs in a dream, it means that God's Prophet is admonishing the one seeing the dream and commanding him to render his wife her due rights. To walk behind him in a dream means following his (Sunnah) traditions in wakefulness. To eat with him in a dream means that one is commanded to pay the annual alms tax (Islamic law) due over one's money-making assets, or liquid assets, gold, silver, jewellery, savings, etc., excepting one's home or vehicle. If one sees God's Prophet eating alone in a dream, it means that the one seeing the dream refuses to give charity and disdains to help those who ask for his help. In this sense, it is as if God's Prophet, upon whom be peace, is commanding the person to give charities and to help the needy. If one sees him barefoot in a dream, it means that one has neglected to do their regular prayers. To see him and to shake hands with him in a dream means that one is truly his follower. If one sees his blood mixed with that of God's Prophet in a dream, it means that one will marry a woman from among his descendants, or that one will marry the daughter of a great religious scholar. If God's Prophet gives someone some type of greens or herbs in a dream, it means that one will escape from a great danger. If he gives him something fresh or honey in the dream, it means that one will learn the Holy Qur'an and acquire great knowledge and wisdom according to the amount he receives in his dream. If one returns the gift to God's Prophet, it means that he will follow innovation. To see him delivering a sermon in a dream means that he is commanding people to do good and to eschew evil. If one sees the colour of his skin tan in a dream, it means that one will think about repenting from his sins and abstain from young people. If the colour of his skin is white in the dream, it means that one will repent for his sins and turn to God Almighty for acceptance. If he reprimands someone in a dream, it means that one must refrain from innovation and follow the prophetic traditions. If one finds that God's Prophet has died in a specific location in a dream, it means that the person seeing the dream will die in that same place, and God knows best.
